                KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICY
                <br />
                To maintain the highest level of security, we require all our
                members to provide us with certain documentation in order to
                validate their accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that the identification procedures shall be done
                before a cardholder starts operating and using services of our
                merchants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why do I need to provide documentation?
                <br />
                There are several reasons:
              </p>
              <p>
                We are committed to providing a socially responsible platform
                for online gaming. All of our members must be 18 or older and we
                are bound by our licensing agreement to verify this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in our
                interests to guarantee maximum security on all transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies are in
                line with international banking standards. A proven business
                relationship with each and every member is mandatory for the
                protection of all parties. Our licensing agreement also obliges
                us to comply with this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, by ensuring that your account details are absolutely
                correct, the inconvenience of 'missing payments' can be avoided.
                It can take weeks (and sometimes months) to trace, recall and
                resend using the correct information. This lengthy process also
                results in additional fees from our processors.
              </p>
              <p>
                WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PROVIDE?
                <br />
                PROOF OF ID:
              </p>
              <p>
                A color copy of a valid government issued form of ID (Driver's
                License, Passport, State ID or Military ID)
              </p>
              <p>
                PROOF OF ADDRESS:
                <br />A copy of a recent utility bill showing your address
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: If your government Id shows your address, you do not need
                to provide further proof of address.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional documentation might be required depending on the
                withdrawal method you choose
              </p>
              <p>
                When do I need to provide these documents?
                <br />
                We greatly appreciate your cooperation in providing these at
                your earliest possible convenience to avoid any delays in
                processing your transactions. We must be in receipt of the
                documents before any cash transactions can be sent back to you.
                Under special circumstances we may require the documents before
                further activity (deposits and wagering) can take place on your
                account
              </p>
              <p>
                Please understand, if we do not have the required documents on
                file, your pending withdrawals will be cancelled and credited
                back to your account. You will be notified when this happens via
                the notification system.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can I send you these documents?
                <br />
                Please scan your documents, or take a high quality digital
                camera picture, save the images as jpegs, then upload the files
                using our secure form here.
              </p>
              <p>
                How do I know my documents are safe with you?
                <br />
                The security of your documentation is of paramount importance.
                All files are protected with the highest level of encryption at
                every step of the review process. All documentation received is
                treated with the utmost respect and confidentiality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We&rsquo;d like to thank you for your cooperation in helping us

                The aim of velkiex is to provide the world&rsquo;s safest and

                the rights of those who take part in games of chance to a

                Responsible Gaming at Skyexchange is based on three fundamental
                principles: Security of the player, Security of the game and
                Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research
                institutes, associations and therapy institutions, we work on
                creation of a responsible, secure and reliable framework for
                online gaming.

              <p>Player security</p>
              <p>
                We take responsibility for the security of our players.
                Protection of the players is based on forbidding the attendance
                of the minors from participation in games and the protection of
                privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data
                and payments. Fairness and the random nature of the products
                offered are monitored closely by independent organizations.
                Marketing communication is also geared towards player
                protection: we promise only what players can receive in our
                transparent line.

                Protection against gaming addiction: research &ndash; prevention
                &ndash; intervention
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and
                other gaming offers play in moderation for entertainment.
                Certain habits and behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing
                sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered
                to be normal and not causing any concern can develop into
                addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way,
                bets on sports and gambling can lead to problems for a small
                group of customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further
                participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently the customers
                are provided with contacts of organizations where they can
                receive professional advice and support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic principle promoted by Skyexchange is that the final
                decision and responsibility on whether to play or not, and how
                much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the
                customer himself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most
                effective form of protection from addiction. Skyexchange sees
                its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing
                transparent products, full information and keeping a clear line
                of conduct.
              </p>
              <p>Protection of minors</p>
              <p>
                velkiex does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to
                participate in games and make bets. That&rsquo;s why the
                confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the
                confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements during
                registration. Skyexchange considers the issue of minors taking
                part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the
                best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support
                of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account
                access in a safe place (user ID and password).
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter
                software. This software will allow you to restrict the access to
                Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers.

              <p>
                velkiex offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of
                entertainment for the majority of customers. At the same time
                the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing
                support and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining
                environment taking into account the associated risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing
                their own limits or those who suffer from gambling addiction are
                not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive
                it as a form of entertainment. Skyexchange takes responsibility
                for such users by blocking their access to its products for
                their own protection.
              </p>
              <p>Get informed with the main issues!</p>
              <p>
                Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games
                within their financial capacity is fully acceptable. However,
                for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of
                entertainment, it is a challenge that must be considered
                seriously.
              </p>
              <p>What is the problematic game behavior?</p>
              <p>
                A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior,
                which interferes mode of life, work, financial position or
                health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is
                counter indicative to such person as it can lead to negative
                consequences.

                In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially
                recognized and enlisted in the list of psychological diseases of
                international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is
                defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination
                for game, despite of existing negative personal and social
                circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and
                delay of professional growth.

              <p>
                In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as
                dependence?
              </p>
              <p>
                It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game
                dependence can be qualified only by experts. The material
                presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define
                your own game behaviour.

              <p>
                The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with
                any substance is that it is very difficult to define the line
                between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some
                diagnostic signals that may point out the existing problems. In
                the presence of at least five of the following symptoms, the
                likelihood of the severe dependence is high:
              </p>
              <p>
                The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are
                only about the game.
                <br />
                Bet sum increases in course of time.
                <br />

                appear to be unsuccessful.
                <br />
                When limiting his participation in gambling, a person
                experiences irritation and disappointment.
                <br />
                The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.
                <br />
                The player tries to win back the lost amount,
                <br />
                Lies about his playing behavior,
                <br />
                Commits illegal acts,
                <br />
                Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,
                <br />
                Borrows to participate in the games.

                1. Use and interpretation
                <br />
                The Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part
                of terms and conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets.
                The Exchange Rules also apply to Exchange
                &rsquo;Multiples&rsquo; product (see the Multiples section below
                for further details). The Exchange Rules consist of the
                following:
              </p>
              <p>
                This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);
                <br />
                The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);
                <br />
                The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below &ndash; these
                apply to certain sports and to financial markets); and
                <br />
                The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the
                tab entitled "Rules" or under the &lsquo;Rules&rsquo;).
                <br />
                The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in
                the Market Information or the Specific Sports Rules. If there is
                any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the
                General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there
                is any inconsistency between the Market Information and either
                the General Rules or the Specific Sports Rules, the Market
                Information shall prevail, except where the General Rules or
                Specific Sports Rules use the phrase 'regardless of what it says
                in the Market Information' or similar wording.
              </p>
              <p>
                For any category or market not referred to in the Specific
                Sports Rules (e.g. &rsquo;Special Bets&rsquo; or beach
                volleyball), the General Rules and Market Information will
                apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Market information
                <br />
                The Market Information is provided for information purposes as
                an at-a-glance guide on how to manage the market. The Market
                Information may also contain rules on market settlement, however
                it must always be read in conjunction with the General Rules and
                the relevant Specific Sports Rules and a link to this Rules and
                Regulations page will usually be provided in the Market
                Information for each market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets
                will be managed, regardless of what it says in the Market
                Information, it reserves the right to suspend any market at any
                time at its sole discretion, including in order to carry out
                necessary administration and/or to take any necessary action to
                protect the customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has
                been loaded except to correct obvious errors and/or to add
                wording to clarify the Market Information where appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Customer responsibility
                <br />
                The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange
                Rules affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet.
                Customers should not simply rely on the Market Information as
                the Market Information is unlikely to contain all of the
                applicable rules relating to a market.
              </p>
              <p>
                By their nature &lsquo;Special Bets&rsquo; markets are
                unpredictable so should be treated with particular caution.
                Customers are responsible for managing their own positions at
                all times in such markets. Customers should pay particular
                attention to the Market Information on &lsquo;Special
                Bets&rsquo; markets to ensure they understand the basis on which
                the market will be administered and settled.
              </p>

                Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the
                Exchange Rules or regarding the settlement of any market should
                contact.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has
                been settled then the customer should provide details of their
                grievance.

                Part B - General rules
                <br />
                1. Managing markets In-Play
                <br />
                a) General
                <br />
                For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a
                market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to
                suspend the market at the relevant time, then:
                <br />
                if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after
                that scheduled off time will be void; and
                <br />
                if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use
                its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual
                'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will
                be void.
                <br />
                For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not
                scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to suspend the market
                at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official
                'off' time will be void.
                <br />
                It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play
                markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does
                not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the
                relevant time.
                <br />
                It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange
                market that has been turned in-play.
                <br />
                Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all
                times.
                <br />
                For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware
                that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may
                be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary
                depending on the set-up through which they are receiving
                pictures or data.
                <br />
                b) All markets other than soccer markets and Australian markets
                - not suspending at the time of the 'off'
                <br />
                In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play,
                aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets
                in-play at the time of the 'off'. The time of the 'off' for such
                markets should be set out in the Market Information. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does
                not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned
                in-play at the time of the 'off'.
                <br />
                If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not
                suspend the market and cancel unmatched bets at the time of the
                'off' and the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets
                cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after
                the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of
                horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the
                official rather than the scheduled 'off' time).
                <br />
                If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use
                its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual
                'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will
                be void.
                <br />
                If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not
                suspend the market at the time of the 'off' (so unmatched bets
                are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally
                turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets
                matched after the time of the 'off' will stand
                <br />
                c) Soccer markets (with the exception of Australian soccer
                markets) - not suspending at kick-off or on the occurrence of a
                Material Event
                <br />
                Not suspending at kick-off
                <br />
                In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned
                in-play, aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such
                markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the
                occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material
                Event" below).
                <br />
                The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the
                Market Information. However, regardless of what it says in the
                Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will
                be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
                <br />
                If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend
                the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at
                any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled
                time of the kick-off will be void.
                <br />
                If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend
                the market at kick-off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at
                that time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time
                during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of
                the kick-off and before the first "Material Event" will stand.
                However, if there has been one or more "Material Events", any
                bets matched between the first "Material Event" and the market
                being turned in-play will be void.
                <br />
                Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event
                <br />
                If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
                Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly
                matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these
                bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a
                game is completed.
                <br />
                Definition of &ldquo;Material Event&rdquo;
                <br />
                For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a "Material Event"
                shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a
                player being sent off.
                <br />
                d) In-play Australian markets
                <br />
                Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in
                relation specifically to any Australian market that is scheduled
                to be turned in-play, if it fails to suspend the market at the
                'off' then all bets matched after the scheduled time of the
                'off' and before the market is turned in-play will be void (in
                the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void
                from the official rather than the scheduled &lsquo;off&rsquo;
                time). If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it
                will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the
                actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' as
                determined will be void.
                <br />
                2. Results and market settlement
                <br />
                a) General
                <br />
                Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information
                and/or the Specific Sports Rules.
                <br />
                Where the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not
                specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets
                will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing
                body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment
                to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
                hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order
                to correct an error in reporting the result).
                <br />
                If no official result of a relevant governing body is available,
                the result will be determined by using information from
                independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes
                into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it
                shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the
                market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
                information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further
                information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the
                market. Except it has announced that it is waiting for further
                information, any information that comes into the public domain
                more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be
                considered (regardless of whether or not such information may
                have led to a different result).
                <br />
                In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential
                result, it reserves the right to suspend settlement of any
                market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be
                resolved to the reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right
                to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement
                cannot be resolved to reasonable satisfaction.
                <br />
                b) Resettlements
                <br />
                Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event
                in question. It may settle (or part-settle) some markets before
                the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's
                'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of
                that customer on a given market) purely as a customer service
                benefit. However, it reserves the right to amend the settlement
                of the market if: (i) the official result is different to the
                result on which initially settled the market (for example, a
                horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing body
                shortly after a race, but before the result is official); or
                (ii) if the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an
                abandoned event).
                <br />
                It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a
                market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical
                error).
                <br />
                If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to
                a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.
                <br />
                c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications
                <br />
                Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions
                or for any exception under the Exchange Rules, if a market
                contains a statement that says, "All bets stand, run or not" (or
                something similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a
                team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the
                team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the
                event.
                <br />
                Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets
                will stand regardless of participation, customers should refer
                to the relevant Specific Sports Rules.
                <br />
                If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits
                after starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at
                least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no
                team or competitor completes an event (having started) then all
                bets will be void except for bets on any markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                d) Winner with [named selection]' markets
                <br />
                It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the
                participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor
                named either in a 'Winner with &hellip;' market title or in the
                Market Information does not participate in the tournament or
                event then all bets on the market will be void. For example, if
                there was a "Winner with Federer" tennis market, all bets on the
                market would be void if Federer did not participate in the
                tournament. However, if any other competitor did not
                participate, then bets would stand.
                <br />A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated
                if they have taken part to the extent necessary to record an
                official result or classification (including any
                disqualification but excluding any "did not start" or equivalent
                classification).
                <br />
                3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements
                <br />
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However,
                where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules or the
                Market Information in relation to an abandonment, cancellation
                and/or postponement the following shall apply.
                <br />
                In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race
                or similar: If the event is not completed within three days
                after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets
                for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that
                have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the
                event is not completed within three days after the scheduled
                completion date, then any markets relating to the event will be
                settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant
                governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90
                days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling
                is announced in this 90-day period, then bets on any market
                relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any
                markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market
                is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to
                customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all
                bets on the market will be void.
                <br />
                It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a
                match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). However, by way
                of example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa League
                outright = tournament; (ii) Champions&rsquo; League Group
                outright = tournament; (iii) Top Premiership goal scorer =
                tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf Match bet = match; (v) Ryder Cup
                outright = tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright =
                tournament; (vii) Tennis Tournament outright = tournament;(viii)
                5-day Cricket Test Match = match; (ix) Ashes Series outright
                winner = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.
                <br />
                4. Change of venue
                <br />
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules
                and/or the Market Information then the following shall apply:
                <br />
                For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the
                market is loaded, all bets will be void only if the new venue is
                a home ground of the original away team
                <br />
                For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the
                scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets
                will stand.
                <br />
                If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a
                hockey match switching from grass to Astor-turf) after the
                market has been loaded, all bets will stand.
                <br />
                5. Periods of time
                <br />
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                Information then the following shall apply.
                <br />
                If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the
                market has been loaded but before the start of the event, then
                all bets will be void.
                <br />
                Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in
                the event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in
                stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it
                will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time
                period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half
                stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have
                occurred on 45 minutes.
                <br />
                All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period
                including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out
                is not included.
                <br />
                References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular
                number of 'days' shall mean the end of the day local time after
                the expiry of the specified number of days. For example, if a
                rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule
                that allows the match to be completed within three days after
                the scheduled completion date (see Paragraph 3 above) would mean
                that the deadline for completion of that match would be 23.59:59
                on the 4th of December.
                <br />
                6. Match bets
                <br />
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. For
                example, for match bets on Golf markets the rules are set out in
                the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the
                Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information then the
                following shall apply.
                <br />
                'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor
                or team with the best score, time or finishing position in the
                event. If none of the competitors or teams involved in the match
                bet complete the event or register a score, time or finishing
                position then bets are void unless specified otherwise in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. Any
                competitor or team not completing an event or registering a
                score, time or finishing position having taken part in the match
                bet event will be settled as a loser providing at least one
                other team or competitor completes that event or registers a
                score, time or finishing position.
                <br />
                'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with
                multiple heats or rounds are determined by the competitor or
                team which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it takes
                part in the further round or not) or with the best score, time
                or finishing position in the final or same heat of that
                competition or event. If the relevant competitors or teams fail
                to qualify in the same round of the competition but in different
                heats then dead-heat rules will apply, irrespective of the
                finishing positions in their respective heats. Markets will be
                part-settled after the end of each round and any subsequent
                disqualifications, penalties or amendments to results or
                qualifications will not have any effect on the market. Where one
                or more of the competitors or teams are disqualified, for the
                purposes of settlement, the disqualified competitor or team will
                be deemed to have progressed further in the competition or event
                than all those eliminated from the competition or event prior to
                the disqualification, and will be deemed to have finished last
                (or joint last if there is more than one disqualification) of
                those still competing in the competition or event.
                Disqualification will be considered to have taken place at the
                time of the competitor's or team's removal from the competition
                or event by the relevant governing body, rather than at the time
                of the event which caused disqualification.
                <br />
                If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the
                event, then all relevant match bets will be void.
                <br />
                If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration
                such that any competitor or team fails to complete the match
                bet, event or tournament for any reason other than withdrawal or
                disqualification then all bets will be void except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                7. "To qualify" markets
                <br />
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                Information then the following shall apply.
                <br />
                Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will
                be determined by the competitor or team that qualifies under the
                terms set out in Market Information, whether or not they take
                part in the next round or event for which they have qualified.
                Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any
                subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not
                count.
                <br />
                8. Dead heats
                <br />
                Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                Market Information the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a
                market where there are more winners than expected (as set out in
                the Market Information).
                <br />
                For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake
                money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the
                sum of the number of winners expected (as set out in the Market
                Information), divided by the number of actual winners (i.e.
                stake multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual
                winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers
                on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded
                price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate
                layers.
                <br />
                For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between
                three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a
                stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken
                the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake
                (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners
                (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate
                the reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer
                (200). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0)
                multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this
                example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the
                original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are 100.
                Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount paid to the
                traded price divided by the number of dead-heaters. In the above
                example, this would be 300 at the traded price of 4.0 (1200)
                divided by 3; making 400 payouts and 100 net winnings.
                <br />
                By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in
                a golf tournament but 7 players tie for 2nd place. In the "top 5
                finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the top
                5 market there would be 4 others designated winner&rsquo;s
                places available. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for
                300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the
                other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake
                (300) is multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of expected winners
                (4) divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to calculate
                the reduced stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the layer
                (128.57). The backer then receives the traded price matched
                (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 = 685.72). In
                this example, Client A's net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout
                minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are
                385.72.
                <br />
                In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the
                purposes of this section of the Exchange Rules dealing with dead
                heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B' and 'appropriate layers'
                should, where relevant, be read
                <br />
                9. Exchange Multiples
                <br />
                The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples.
              </p>
              <p>
                Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other
                will act as the counterparty to the bet.
                <br />A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is
                defined as one or more chosen selections in any individual event
                market.
                <br />
                It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept
                certain multiple bets or to scale back stakes in certain
                circumstances.
                <br />
                All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that
                apply to each individual sport that relates to any leg of any
                multiple bet.
                <br />
                The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is
                &pound;1,000,000.
                <br />
                Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or
                where available lay or a mixture of back and lay selections.
                However, customers cannot have a combination of back and lay
                selections in any one leg.
                <br />
                If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds
                for this leg will be "dutched" which means they will be combined
                to reflect the chances of any of the selections within the leg
                winning (if backed) or all of the selections losing (if laid).
                If customers wish to place a cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than
                one selection in any event market but not using "dutched"
                prices) they will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet
                separately.
                <br />
                Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price
                ("BSP"), the odds available via the Exchange Multiples product
                will be broadly based on the relevant singles markets on the
                Exchange and any such winning multiple bet will be subject to
                commission as set out in the Charges' section of the website.
                <br />
                Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not
                be subject to commission, but the odds returned on each leg in
                such a multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from the BSP.
                <br />A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for
                selections in the multiple to win and a bet on the same
                selections to place. For example, a &pound;2 each way double
                represents a &pound;2 bet on both selections to win and a
                &pound;2 bet on both selections to be placed, with a total stake
                for the bet of &pound;4. The number of places for each event in
                each way multiples bet are shown on the multiples win Market
                Information and do not change. Should the number of runners be
                equal to or less than the number of places available, the
                relevant place leg of any multiples bet will be void
                <br />
                The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is
                &pound;2. For example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet combinations)
                representing a total stake of &pound;2.20 is permitted. However,
                a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet combinations) representing a total stake of
                &pound;0.57 or a &pound;1 double (1 bet combination)
                representing a total stake of &pound;1 will not be permitted.
                For customers betting in currencies other than English Sterling,
                the minimum total stake which applies to an Exchange Multiple
                bet will not necessarily be the equivalent of &pound;2, though
                it will be calculated as described in the example above.
                <br />
                If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are
                available for Exchange Multiples. Events available for Exchange
                Multiples will be those listed within any individual Exchange
                Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures for any given day).
                Not all markets will be available via the Exchange Multiples
                product.
                <br />
                With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection
                in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void under the Exchange
                Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that individual
                leg will be void and the Exchange Multiple bet shall be adjusted
                accordingly. For example, a treble including one void leg will
                become a double. This means that if customers have more than one
                selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one of
                those selections is a non-runner, the whole leg will be void. In
                the event that voided legs mean that an individual bet within a
                multiple becomes a single bet, then this single bet will stand.
                <br />
                Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples
                bets struck at BSP, if customers have more than one selection in
                any leg and one of those selections is a non-runner the leg will
                stand. For example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red
                Rum in an individual horse race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the
                leg will become a back of just Desert Orchid.
                <br />
                It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of
                Exchange Multiples, such as those including related
                contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is likely to
                affect the odds on the outcome of another event). This may
                happen automatically at the bet placement stage. Alternatively,
                if such bet is taken in error, it may void the individual bet
                combinations which include two or more of the related
                contingency selections.
                <br />
                It may offer special markets on related events from time to
                time, including within its normal markets (i.e. outside of the
                Exchange Multiples product), for example a market on Chelsea to
                win the English domestic double (i.e. Premiership and FA Cup).
                <br />
                When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown only
                give an indicative guide as to the price available for each leg
                and the overall multiple. Other than Exchange Multiples bets
                struck at BSP, the price of each leg and the overall multiple
                price that customers get will be fixed when the multiple bet is
                actually placed and customers will then be able to see these
                prices. For more details on this customer should refer to the
                'help' files.
                <br />
                Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on &lsquo;day of the
                race&rsquo; markets (and not ante-post markets). Horseracing
                ante-post rules do not therefore apply in relation to
                horseracing Exchange Multiples.
                <br />
                10. Rules for Starting Price
                <br />
                Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP
                bets (&lsquo;SP bets&rsquo;) are therefore a type of Exchange
                bet. The SP is calculated as, by balancing all SP bets and other
                Exchange bets when the market is suspended at the 'off' of the
                relevant event. The details of this calculation are provided
                directly below.
                <br />
                Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be
                cancelled once it has been placed.
                <br />A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each
                selection being calculated and bets matched when the event
                starts. The odds are calculated by matching SP backers and other
                Exchange backers against SP layers and other Exchange layers.
                The inclusion of other Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is
                necessary to ensure that: SP backers get the benefit of
                unmatched Exchange offers to lay if those offers could increase
                the SP; and SP layers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange
                offers to back if those offers could reduce the SP. Including
                unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures
                that the bets of other Exchange backers and layers, which would
                otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.
                <br />
                The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is &pound;10 for a
                lay bet and &pound;2 for a back bet (or the currency equivalent
                in each case).
                <br />
                Example 1: on selection A there is &pound;1,000 of backers'
                stakes and &pound;6,000 of layers' liabilities at SP and there
                are &pound;500 of unmatched other Exchange back bets available
                to lay at an average of 5.0. If we ignored the Exchange market
                in this case the SP would be 7.0. However, this would leave
                other Exchange back bets, that could also have been matched at
                their requested price against SP layers, unmatched. Therefore,
                the SP will be 5.0 and all SP backers and SP layers will be
                matched at that price. The &pound;500 of Exchange backers'
                stakes will also be matched at their requested price of 5.0
                against the SP layers.
                <br />
                Example 2: on selection B there are &pound;831 of backers'
                stakes and &pound;4,428 of layers' liabilities at SP and the
                following unmatched other Exchange lay bets, available to back:
                &pound;20 at 6.8, &pound;31.13 at 6.6 and &pound;100 at 6.4. In
                this case the SP will be 6.68. This is calculated by including
                the &pound;20 available to back at 6.8 and the &pound;31.13
                available to back at 6.6 and balancing those amounts against the
                SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The &pound;100
                available to back on the Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched as to
                include any of this amount would lead to an imbalance between SP
                backers and SP layers.
                <br />
                The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection,
                though it may be displayed in the relevant market view (or in
                any form/results data) to two decimal places, rounded up or down
                as applicable. After reconciliation, the full SP on each
                selection is available by clicking on the relevant individual
                runner graph.
                <br />
                If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event
                starts or the SP cannot otherwise be reconciled at the
                'off&rsquo;, it will determine the SP using all available
                information. For the avoidance of doubt this information will
                not be limited to betting activity on the relevant market(s).
                Also in these circumstances, a licensed betting operator within
                the group may act as risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary
                to ensure a fair SP. The personnel involved in determining the
                SP in such circumstances will have no undeclared personal or
                other interest in the SP in question.
                <br />
                If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for
                example if a horserace is turned in-play in error), then it will
                endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so that the SP is
                determined when the event starts. There may however be
                circumstances in which this is not possible, in which case the
                SP will be based on the initial reconciliation.
                <br />
                In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets
                (including SP limit bets), 'At In-play: Take SP' bets and 'At
                In-play: Keep' bets will all revert to their status before the
                reconciliation; and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets will either remain
                cancelled if not matched as part of the reconciliation process,
                or if matched as part of the reconciliation process, will revert
                to their unmatched status before the reconciliation.
                <br />
                If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than
                scheduled (i.e. after the event has started) and determines that
                a material event has occurred (this will generally mean that the
                event is not turned in-play), the SP will be determined based
                solely on SP bets (and &lsquo;At In-play: Take SP&rsquo; bets
                which are unmatched when suspends the relevant market), placed
                before the 'off'. This means that &lsquo;At In-play: Take
                SP&rsquo; bets matched after the off, will be made void and not
                included in the reconciliation process. In addition, SP bets
                placed after the 'off' will be voided. However, if the SP
                reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled but
                determines that no material event has occurred, all bets will
                stand.
                <br />
                If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as
                two separate bets: a win bet at SP and a 'to be placed' bet at
                SP.
                <br />
                If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market
                going in-play, then any unmatched bets that have been selected
                to 'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted to SP bets. Once
                those bets are converted, they cannot be cancelled.
                <br />➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP
                <br />
                When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other
                customers. However, during the reconciliation of the SP, it acts
                as counterparty in order to balance liabilities between SP bets
                and other Exchange bets
                <br />➢ Placing a SP bet
                <br />
                Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two
                different ways to request an SP bet. These are as follows:
                <br />
                The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP
                odds limit' box unticked at the top right of the bet manager.
                For a back bet you are required to enter the stake you wish to
                bet on the selection. For a lay bet, you are required to enter
                the liability you are prepared to risk against the selection
                &ndash; in other words the amount that you are prepared to lose,
                should the selection win (or be placed as applicable).
                <br />
                The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP
                odds limit' option. Using this you can request a bet at SP
                conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of a back bet, or
                maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet. If SP is shorter than
                the minimum price requested by a backer or is longer than the
                maximum price requested by a layer, then the relevant bet will
                lapse when the event starts. If SP is longer than the minimum
                price requested by a backer or is shorter than the maximum price
                requested by a layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where
                an SP is equal to the price limit specified by customers, those
                bets will be included based on the time they were submitted, on
                a first come, first served basis as is the existing convention
                for other Exchange bets. This means that such bets may be
                unmatched or partially matched.
                <br />
                Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the
                relevant market until after the completion of the event, the
                application to all bets matched at or before the "off"
                (including SP bets) of any reduction factor, may mean that the
                matched price for an SP back bet with an odds limit requested,
                is adjusted to a price below the lower limit requested. It may
                also mean that an SP lay bet request with maximum odds
                requested, may not be matched even though the odds on the
                selection, after any post-race adjustment for the late
                non-runner, is below the maximum odds requested.
                <br />
                If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the
                minimum/maximum odds requested can be shortened in the case of a
                back bet or a lengthened in the case of a lay bet at any time
                before the event starts. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet
                request cannot actually be cancelled by a customer once it has
                been placed. Details of the impact of non-runners on the SP re
                provided below.
                <br />➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'
                <br />A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of
                your selection from the market view (as opposed to clicking on
                the 'SP' of your selection). When such an Exchange bet is fully
                or partially unmatched it can be adjusted and cancelled in the
                normal course. Previously, unmatched bets were automatically
                cancelled when a market was suspended at the 'off' of the
                relevant event. You can now choose to either have your unmatched
                Exchange bet convert to an SP bet when the market suspends at
                the start of the event, or to have the bet 'persist' when the
                event goes in-play (see the 'keep' option below).
                <br />
                In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet
                when the market suspends you should select the 'At In-Play: Take
                SP' option in the bet manager. If there is a non-runner in a win
                market with a reduction factor of at least 2.5%, or a non-runner
                in a place market with a reduction factor of at least 4%, it is
                policy to cancel unmatched lay bets on all other runners in the
                market. In the case of any such non-runner, instead of being
                cancelled a lay bet for which the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option
                has been selected, will automatically convert to an SP bet.
                After this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled. Otherwise,
                unlike an SP bet, you can choose to cancel an Exchange bet once
                it has been placed, even if you have chosen for the bet to
                persist or to convert to an SP bet at the start of the event.
                <br />
                If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP
                bet, the liability of your Exchange lay bet will be converted
                into a liability for the SP bet. Your liability for that SP bet
                will never be more than the liability for the Exchange bet you
                had specified. However, the amount you can win on the SP lay bet
                may differ from the amount you would have won had the Exchange
                bet been matched, depending on the final SP.
                <br />➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners
                <br />
                For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the
                odds requested by a customer, despite any non-runners or
                withdrawals. However, customers who have selected the SP limit
                option can reduce the minimum SP odds they are prepared to
                accept on a selection.
                <br />
                For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's
                liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any non-runner(s)
                and the reduction factor of the runner on which the customer's
                bet has been placed. This is to ensure that the balance between
                the backers' stakes and the layers' liability reflects the
                revised market after the runner has been removed. For example,
                if a horse with a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner,
                then another horse in the same market priced at about 5 (i.e. a
                reduction factor of 20%) will change to a price of about 2.5.
                Therefore, the liability on a &pound;200 lay bet on that runner
                will need to change to a liability of about &pound;75 to ensure
                that a balancing back bet will have the same &pound;50 stake.
                This is done by multiplying the liability by 37.5% (i.e.
                100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).
                <br />
                Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit
                specified, this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of
                any non-runner, if the non-runner has a reduction factor of at
                least 2.5%.
                <br />
                For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a
                customer's liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any
                non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly different, in
                line with the application of place market reduction factors. The
                liability will be reduced by the reduction factor of the removed
                runner. Where the lay bet on a place market has a maximum odds
                limit specified, the potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the
                odds &ndash; 1) will be reduced by the reduction factor of the
                removed runner.
                <br />
                Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit
                specified this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of
                any non-runner.
                <br />
                SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.
                <br />➢ Specific conditions for SP bets for non-runners in
                greyhound racing markets
                <br />
                ALL SP bets will stand so long as your trap selection is not
                vacant or after your bet placement a reserve runner is not
                subsequently entered to run from your trap selection.
                <br />
                ALL unmatched &lsquo;Convert to SP&rsquo; bets will be cancelled
                when a reserve is added or a vacant trap removed.
                <br />
                11. 'Keep' bets option
                <br />
                For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the
                'off', a customer can request that an unmatched Exchange bet
                should not be cancelled when the market is turned in-play. This
                is done by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option in the bet
                manager (and confirming that request) and means that the
                unmatched bet persists when other unmatched bets are cancelled
                at the start of the event.
                <br />
                As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a
                horseracing market (apart for late withdrawals as described in
                the next bullet point below), it is policy to cancel unmatched
                offers to lay all other horses in the market if the non-runner
                has a reduction factor of 2.5% or greater for win markets, or
                4.0% or greater for place markets. In these circumstances offers
                to lay a horse with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will
                not be cancelled. Instead the lay odds offered in place markets
                will be reduced in proportion with the reduction factors of any
                non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win markets providing
                the relevant non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
                <br />
                When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the
                non-runner from the market before turning it in-play. In such
                cases if can determine that the late withdrawal is a material
                runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 20%
                or greater in the win market), it reserves the right to cancel
                ALL lay 'keep' bets (in both the win and &lsquo;to be
                placed&rsquo; markets) before turning the market in-play. If it
                does not cancel lay 'keep' bets in the case of a late withdrawal
                (for example, it may not be possible to know which horse is
                withdrawn, at the time of the off), any such bets placed before
                the off and matched in-play will remain at the original selected
                price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be subject
                to any reduction factor which as a result of the late
                withdrawal, will be applied after the completion of the race to
                bets matched at or before the 'off'.
                <br />
                Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel
                'keep' bets to protect customers but, unless stipulated in the
                market rules or the market information, the general principle is
                that at no point will a 'keep' bet be cancelled by unless it
                remains unmatched when the market is closed (for the final time)
                at the end of the event.
                <br />
                For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a
                Material Event occurs in a soccer match and other unmatched bets
                are cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet will not
                be cancelled.
                <br />
                12. Rules for Tote betting
                <br />
                When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or
                South African Tote bet), you are betting against as counterparty
                to your bet. I will then strike a corresponding bet into the
                relevant Tote pool as applicable.
                <br />A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as
                counterparty is provided within each of the relevant. If there
                is any conflict between those rules and either: the equivalent
                rules available on the relevant Tote website (for example on the
                UK Tote website in the case of UK Tote bets); or the equivalent
                rules applied by the relevant host racetrack, the rules on the
                relevant Tote website or applied by the relevant host racetrack,
                will prevail.
                <br />
                13. Miscellaneous
                <br />
                All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to
                the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a
                reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the
                local kick-off time.
                <br />
                All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot
                accept liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any
                information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times,
                scores, results or general statistics.
                <br />
                It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall
                take all reasonable steps to ensure markets are administered
                with integrity and transparency.
                <br />
                If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding
                minor spelling mistakes) or the incorrect number of teams,
                competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a
                market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information (for
                example the application of an incorrect exposure algorithm or a
                cross matching tool utilising an incorrect algorithm) or
                includes any obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of
                the cross matching tool, then It reserves the right to suspend
                the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets
                matched on the market.
                <br />
                Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy
                themselves that the selection on which they place a bet is their
                intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor
                bearing the same name as another individual not competing in the
                relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they
                know which competitor It has loaded into the relevant market and
                to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen
                competitor.
                <br />
                It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute
                discretion to suspend an Exchange market.
                <br />
                It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend
                betting on a market at any time (even if such suspension is
                earlier than anticipated by the Exchange Rules). In the
                interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets,
                it may also void certain bets in a market or void a whole market
                in its entirety.
                <br />
                It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time.
                <br />
                It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect
                customers at any time.
                <br />
                On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to
                <br />
                winnings/losses on bets; and
                <br />
                commission charges
                <br />
                will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places
                (with the exception that rounding will always be down (and never
                up) in respect of amounts relating to winnings/losses in respect
                of BSP bets). By way of example, &pound;3.333, will be settled
                as &pound;3.33, whereas &pound;3.335, will be settled as
                &pound;3.34 (except that it will be settled as &pound;3.33 in
                respect of an amount relating to winnings/losses in respect of
                BSP bets).
                <br />
                The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other
                than English for reference only. In the event of any differences
                between the English version and the non-English version, the
                English version shall prevail.
                <br />
                Part C - Specific sports rules
                <br />
                1. American Football
                <br />
                All markets will be settled on the result including overtime
                unless stated otherwise in these American Football Rules or in
                the Market Information (e.g. the half time/full time market) or
                where the market has been unconditionally determined. If the
                game results in a tie after overtime all bets on the outright
                match winner market will be void.
                <br />
                If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date and is
                not completed within three days of the scheduled completion
                date, all bets will be void except for those on markets which
                have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed, then
                within three days of the scheduled start date:(a) at least 55
                minutes of play must have elapsed; or (b) an official result
                must be 'called' by the relevant governing body; otherwise all
                bets will be void, except for those on markets which have been
                unconditionally determined. In those instances, if the scores
                are tied then all bets on the outright match winner market will
                be void.
                <br />
                For 'Individual player' markets, bets shall be void on any
                player who does not start in any down during the match.
                <br />
                2. Athletics
                <br />
                Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled
                on the official result of the relevant governing body at the
                time of the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result.
                <br />
                If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                determined in accordance with the official result of the
                relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting
                the result).
                <br />
                Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, if a track or
                field event is abandoned, cancelled or postponed and not
                completed within 7 days of the scheduled completion date, all
                bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                3. Australian Rules Football
                <br />
                Bets apply to regular time excluding overtime. However, bets on
                "Finals" matches apply to regular time including overtime except
                for those on markets which have been unconditionally determined
                or as stated otherwise in the Market Information (e.g.
                half-time/full-time markets). If the game results in a tie,
                dead-heat rules apply to bets on the match odds market.
                <br />
                If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date and is
                not completed within three days of the scheduled start date, all
                bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is abandoned or postponed before half-time
                and not completed within three days of the scheduled start date
                then the match shall be deemed to be a tie and settled on
                dead-heat rules. If a match starts but is abandoned or postponed
                in the second half and not completed within three days of the
                scheduled start date then the match shall be settled on the
                official result of the relevant governing body. In both
                instances, bets on the match odds market will be settled as set
                out above and all other bets will be void except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                All bets relating to any individual player will stand if they
                are listed in any 22-player squad on the match day, irrespective
                of whether they take any part in the match or not.
                <br />
                4. Baseball
                <br />
                These Baseball Rules apply to Major League Baseball (MLB), World
                Baseball Classic and Japanese Baseball only. All other baseball,
                including Finnish Baseball for example, will be governed by the
                rules set out in the General Rules and the Market Information.
                <br />
                If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date, all
                bets will be void.
                <br />
                If an MLB match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and
                an official result is not declared within three days of the
                scheduled start date, all bets will be void, except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                If a Japanese Baseball match starts but is later abandoned or
                postponed and the match is not completed within three days of
                the scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those
                on markets which have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                All bets will include extra innings, unless otherwise stated in
                the Market Information.
                <br />
                All bets on 'Total runs' or 'Run line' markets will be void
                unless there have been at least 9 innings completed (8 1/2 if
                the home team is ahead) except those on market which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                In "Listed" markets, bets will be void unless both named
                pitchers listed in the market start as pitchers in the first
                fielding innings for their respective teams.
                <br />
                5. Basketball
                <br />
                Bets will be settled on the result including overtime unless
                stated otherwise in the Market Information or where the market
                has been unconditionally determined or as set out in these
                Basketball rules.
                <br />
                If a match does not start on the scheduled start date then all
                bets will be void.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then,
                within three days of the scheduled start date, (a) at least 43
                minutes of play must have elapsed in any NBA match or 35 minutes
                of play must have elapsed in any other match; or (b) an official
                result must be 'called' by the relevant governing body;
                otherwise all bets will be void, except for those on markets
                which have been unconditionally determined. In these instances,
                if the scores are tied then dead heat rules will apply to bets
                on the outright match winner market.
                <br />
                6. Boxing and Mixed Martial Arts
                <br />
                All individual bout markets will be settled according to the
                official result of the relevant governing body immediately after
                the end of the fight, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in tallying
                the points or in order to correct an error in reporting the
                result).
                <br />
                If a fight is abandoned, cancelled or postponed and not
                completed within three days of the scheduled start date, or a
                boxer is withdrawn or substituted before the first-round bell,
                all bets will be void.
                <br />
                If a boxer retires before the start of a round, fails to answer
                the bell, or is disqualified for any reason between rounds, the
                fight will be deemed to have finished at the end of the previous
                round.
                <br />
                If one of the boxers is disqualified they will be deemed a
                loser.
                <br />
                If the scheduled duration of the fight is altered in time or
                number of rounds after the loading of the relevant markets, then
                all bets will be void.
                <br />
                If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been
                loaded so that the new venue is changed to a venue in a
                different country then all bets will be void. For all other
                changes to the scheduled venue bets will stand.
                <br />
                In mixed martial arts, if a fight is declared a 'no contest', a
                draw or a technical draw then all bets will be void.
                <br />
                7. Cricket
                <br />➢ General
                <br />
                If a ball is not bowled during a competition, series or match
                then all bets will be void except for those on any market that
                has been unconditionally determined (e.g. in the 'Completed
                Match' market).
                <br />
                If a match is shortened by weather, all bets will be settled
                according to the official result (including for limited overs
                matches, the result determined by the Duckworth Lewis method).
                <br />
                In the event of a match being decided by a bowl-off or toss of
                the coin, all bets will be void except for those on markets that
                have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />➢ Test matches
                <br />
                If a match starts but is later abandoned for any reason other
                than weather (which may include but is not limited to: dangerous
                or unplayable wicket or outfield; pitch vandalism; strike or
                boycott; crowd protests/violence; stadium damage; acts of
                terrorism; and acts of God), It reserves the right to void all
                bets, except for those on markets that have been unconditionally
                determined.
                <br />
                If the match is not scheduled to be completed within five days
                after the original scheduled completion date, then all bets on
                markets for this event will be void, except for bets on any
                markets that have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />➢ Limited Over matches
                <br />
                If a match is declared "No Result'', bets will be void on all
                markets for the event except for those markets which have been
                unconditionally determined or where the minimum number of overs
                have been bowled as laid out in the market specific information.
                <br />
                In the event of a new toss taking place on a scheduled reserve
                day for a limited over match all bets that were placed after 30
                minutes before the original scheduled start of play on the first
                day will be made void. This rule relates to all markets except
                those that have been unconditionally determined (e.g. in the win
                the toss and toss combination markets).
                <br />➢ Super Over rule
                <br />
                Which team will win this Super Over? This market will be
                suspended on site and activated once Betfair are aware a Super
                Over is to be played. The market will be turned in-play at the
                start of the Super Over. This market will not be actively
                managed therefore it is the responsibility of all customers to
                manage their positions. This market will be settled based on the
                number of runs scored by each team in the initial Super Over.
                For the avoidance of doubt, if scores are tied at the completion
                of both innings in the Super Over then the market will be
                settled as a Dead Heat except in cases where more than one Super
                Over is played, where it will be settled on the winner of the
                final over. Any tie breaker that may be used to determine a
                winner including but not limited to higher number of boundaries,
                higher number of sixes, losing fewer wickets, coin toss etc. do
                not count for the purposes of this market.
                <br />
                8. Cycling
                <br />
                Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled
                on the official result of the relevant governing body at the
                time of the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result.
                <br />
                If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                determined in accordance with the official result of the
                relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting
                the result).

                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting

                In any 'to qualify' market for any tournament the winners are
                the number of golfers that qualify for the tournament under the
                terms set out in the Market Information, whether they compete in
                the tournament or not. Markets will be settled after the

                placed after the official off time will be void, except on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined, which will
                stand. Bets on 2 or 3 balls will only be void if matched after
                the tee time of the relevant 2 or 3 balls.
                <br />
                If it does not suspend a tournament market and cancel unmatched
                bets at the time stated in the market rules but the market is
                turned in-play at a later time, all bets matched between the
                start of a day&rsquo;s play and the time the market is turned
                in-play will be void.
                <br />➢ Tournament match betting (i.e. 72-hole match bets)
                <br />
                If a player withdraws without playing a stroke all bets on the
                relevant market will be void.
                <br />
                If all players fail to complete a particular round for any
                reason the winner is the player with the lowest total score
                after the previous round.
                <br />
                If a player is disqualified or withdraws during any round they
                will be settled as a loser providing at least one other player
                completes that round.
                <br />
                Should all players fail to complete the first round then all
                bets will be void.

                <br />
                If a player withdraws without playing a stroke in that round all
                bets on the relevant market will be void.
                <br />
                If one player fails to complete a round for any reason other
                than a withdrawal or disqualification then all bets will be void
                except for those on markets which have been unconditionally
                determined.
                <br />
                Any player withdrawing or being disqualified having played a
                stroke in that round will be settled as a loser providing at
                least one other player completes that round.
                <br />
                Should all players fail to complete the round then all bets will
                be void.
                <br />➢ Stroke play hole-by-hole markets (i.e. performance of a
                named player on a given hole)
                <br />
                Should a hole not be completed for any reason all bets on that
                hole will be void unless the market has been unconditionally
                determined.
                <br />
                Markets are settled on completion of the hole and any subsequent
                penalties or disqualification will not be taken into account.
                <br />➢ Match play hole-by-hole markets (i.e. performance of
                players against each other on a given hole)
                <br />
                With the exception of a player or team conceding a hole (where
                they are deemed a loser), if a hole is not completed by any
                player or team (other than for withdrawal or disqualification)
                all bets on that hole will be void unless the market has been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                Any player or team withdrawing or being disqualified having
                played a stroke on that hole will be settled as a loser

                will be void.
                <br />
                Markets are settled on completion of the hole and any subsequent

                <br />
                13. Greyhound racing
                <br />➢ General
                <br />
                All bets (excluding those struck on ante-post and Australian
                licensed markets) are placed on trap numbers. Greyhound names
                are displayed for information purposes only.
                <br />
                Markets will be determined according to the official result at
                the time the track gives the result green light status, either
                in the form of an announcement or by display. Subsequent
                disqualifications, appeals or amendments to the result will be
                disregarded.
                <br />
                If a non-runner or reserve runner is declared, then all bets
                prior to the update of the market on It will be void and all
                unmatched bets including &lsquo;Take SP&rsquo; and
                &lsquo;keep&rsquo; bets will be cancelled (except for certain SP
                bets as set out in Paragraph 10.5 of Part B above).
                <br />
                If there are no finishers in any race or any race is declared
                void before the official result is declared then all bets will
                be void.
                <br />
                If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been
                loaded by It, all bets will be void.
                <br />
                In ante-post markets, all bets on individual greyhounds stand
                whether the greyhound runs or not. All ante-post bets will be
                void if the competition is abandoned or the venue is changed.
                <br />➢ Trap Challenge
                <br />
                Bets on 'Trap challenge' markets are based on which trap results
                in the most winners during a race meeting, unless stated
                otherwise in the Market Information.
                <br />
                These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners
                or reserve runners.
                <br />
                If a race results in a dead heat each trap will receive a
                half-win, with a 3-way dead heat giving a one third-win, and so
                on.
                <br />
                Standard dead heat rules apply if two or more traps have an
                equal number of winners at the end of both meetings.
                <br />
                If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if
                at least one race has been completed then bets on these markets
                will stand.
                <br />➢ Multi-trap or Multiplied Trap Numbers
                <br />
                'Multi-trap' or 'multiplied trap numbers' bets are on the
                cumulative sum of the winning trap multiplied by the second trap
                for each race during a race meeting, unless stated otherwise in
                the Market Information. If the cumulative sum is not a round
                number then that sum shall be rounded up to give the applicable
                cumulative sum.
                <br />
                These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners
                or reserve runners.
                <br />
                If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned or if there is only
                one finisher in a race, an eight runner-greyhound races will be
                allocated 20 points and all other races will be allocated 12
                points.
                <br />
                If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void however if at
                least one race has been completed then bets on these markets
                will stand with the remaining races allocated 20 points for
                eight runner greyhound races and 12 points for all other races.
                <br />
                Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.
                <br />
                If there is a dead heat for the winner between two greyhounds
                then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number for that race
                the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat
                will be multiplied by each other to give the applicable
                multi-trap number.
                <br />
                If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more
                greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number
                for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in
                the dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of
                greyhounds involved in the dead heat and the resulting number
                will be multiplied by itself to give the applicable multi-trap
                number (even if not a round number). By way of example: traps 1,
                3 and 6 dead heat for first. Add these numbers up gives 10;
                divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat
                (3) which gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by
                itself to give 11.11.
                <br />
                If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more
                greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number
                for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in
                the dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of
                greyhounds involved in the dead heat and the resulting number
                will be multiplied by the number of the winner to give the
                applicable multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By
                way of example: trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6 dead heat for
                second. Adding the numbers of the dead heating runners up gives
                9; divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead
                heat (2) which gives a resulting number of 4.5; multiple 4.5 by
                the winning number (1) to give 4.5.
                <br />➢ Winning Distances
                <br />
                'Winning distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances
                for all races during a race meeting, unless otherwise stated in
                the Market Information.
                <br />
                The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.
                <br />
                If there is only one finisher in any race the winning distance
                will be deemed to be 10 lengths.
                <br />
                If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned the winning distance
                will be deemed to be 2 lengths.
                <br />
                Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.
                <br />
                For distances below half a length, the following scale will be
                applied: Short-head 0.1; Head 0.2; Neck 0.3.
                <br />
                The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the
                nearest whole number at the end of the meeting (rounded up, if
                half) and bets will be settled on this result.
                <br />
                If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if
                at least one race has been completed then the remaining races
                are allocated 2 lengths each and bets will stand.
                <br />➢ Match Bets
                <br />
                'Match Bets' for a race are determined by the greyhound with the
                highest finishing position in that race. If neither greyhound
                finishes the race bets are void. If only one of the greyhounds
                finishes the race, that greyhound will be deemed the winner. If
                a non-runner or reserve runner is declared then all bets will be
                void.
                <br />
                'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the
                greyhound which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it runs
                in the further round or not). If the greyhounds concerned fail
                to qualify in the same round of the competition then the market
                will be settled as a dead heat, irrespective of their finishing
                positions in their individual heats.
                <br />➢ Reverse Forecasts
                <br />
                'Reverse Forecast' markets are determined by those greyhounds
                placed first and second in a race.
                <br />
                If a dead heat affects the reverse forecast then dead heat rules
                apply.
                <br />➢ Place markets
                <br />
                The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in
                the Market Information and is determined with reference to the
                number of runners when the market is loaded.
                <br />
                Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets (as
                set out in the Market Information) will not be affected by
                further non-runners. If the number of potential winners is equal
                to or is greater than the number of runners, all bets in this
                market will be void.
                <br />➢ To Reach the Final and To Qualify markets
                <br />
                'Reach the Final' markets shall be determined by the first six
                greyhounds who qualify from the Semi Finals of the competition
                and be settled as such regardless of whether they go on to run
                in the final or not.
                <br />
                'To qualify' markets shall be determined by the greyhounds that
                qualify in the relevant heats irrespective of whether they run
                in the next round or not.
                <br />
                The 'reach the final' or 'to qualify' markets will be settled
                after the qualifying stages and any subsequent disqualification
                or amendment to results will not count.
                <br />➢ Ante-post
                <br />
                If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use
                the available information to determine the time of the
                greyhound's death. It will then, acting reasonably, determine
                whether the greyhound was a 'material runner' in the market. In
                determining whether a greyhound is a material runner, it will
                look at the general price of the greyhound immediately before
                the greyhound's death, in the market and in the wider betting
                market. Broadly, it will consider a greyhound to be a material
                runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of winning
                of 8-10 per cent or better.
                <br />
                If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner',
                then all bets struck in the market (on all selections) between
                the time of death and the suspension of the market will be void
                and all unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is
                reopened.
                <br />
                If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner',
                then just bets struck on the greyhound in question between the
                time of death and the suspension of the market will be void and
                unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is
                reopened.
                <br />
                Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry
                at a particular entry stage or where they have not qualified by
                the applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in
                question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
                <br />
                Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the
                same venue then ante-post bets will stand unless entries are
                reopened in which case all bets will be void.
                <br />➢ Australian Specific Non-Runner Rules
                <br />
                Notwithstanding any of the above, the following rules apply to
                declared non-runners in Australian greyhound markets.
                <br />
                If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is
                loaded but prior to the commencement of the race it will be
                removed and all bets on the market, matched prior to the update
                of the market will be voided.
                <br />
                If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a
                greyhound a non-runner, it will resettle the market and will
                void all bets that were placed on that runner only. It will then
                apply a reduction factor to all bets placed on the winner (or
                place getters in the case of place markets) based on that
                runner&rsquo;s weighted average price.
                <br />
                14. Horseracing
                <br />➢ General
                <br />
                All individual race markets will be determined according to the
                official result at the time of the 'weigh-in' announcement (or
                equivalent). Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments
                to the result will be disregarded.
                <br />
                If a race is abandoned or otherwise declared void, or in the
                event of a walkover, all bets on that race will be void.
                <br />
                If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been
                loaded, all bets will be void.
                <br />
                Where a race does not take part on its scheduled day, all bets
                will be void.
                <br />
                If a scheduled surface type is changed (e.g. turf to dirt) all
                bets will stand.
                <br />
                Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on &lsquo;day of the
                race&rsquo; markets (and not ante-post markets). Horseracing
                ante-post rules do not therefore apply in relation to
                horseracing Exchange Multiples.
                <br />➢ Ante-post
                <br />
                Subject to the points below, in ante-post markets, all bets on
                an individual horse stand whether the horse runs or not.
                <br />
                For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all bets on
                that horse will be void.
                <br />
                If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the
                available information to determine the time of the horse's
                death. It will be acting reasonably, determine whether the horse
                was a 'material runner' in the market. It will undertake a
                similar determination in cases where it is advised through
                official channels that a runner has been formally scratched from
                an ante-post race. In determining whether a horse is a material
                runner, it will consider the general price of the horse
                immediately before the horse's death (or immediately before
                being advised it has been scratched), in the market and in the
                wider betting market. Broadly, it will consider a horse to be a
                material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of
                winning of 8-10 per cent or better.
                <br />
                If it determines that the horse was a 'material runner', then
                all bets struck in the market (on all selections) between the
                time of death (or the time that the formal scratching
                notification was created) and the suspension of the market will
                be void and all unmatched bets will be cancelled before the
                market is reopened.
                <br />
                If it determines that the horse was not a 'material runner',
                then just bets struck on the horse in question between the time
                of death (or the time that the formal scratching notification
                was created) and the suspension of the market will be void and
                unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is
                reopened.
                <br />
                Bets matched on horses after they have forfeited their entry at
                a particular entry stage or where they have not qualified by the
                applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in
                question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
                <br />
                Please be aware that runners who have not been entered at the
                various entry stages may be removed from relevant race markets
                and all matched customer bet prices set to 1.0 even if there are
                later supplementary stages. Should it appear likely that a
                specific runner may actually be supplemented into the race this
                runner will be reinstated with all matched customer bets set
                back to the original prices.
                <br />
                No Non-Runner Rule' reductions are made to ante-post bets.
                <br />
                All relevant bets will be void where an event is: abandoned and
                not rescheduled; or postponed and rescheduled to another venue;
                or postponed and rescheduled to another day at the same venue
                with entries for the race being reopened or reverting back to a
                previous entry or declaration stage provided any additional
                horses are entered or re-entered and such entries or
                declarations are considered, in absolute discretion, material to
                the betting on the race. For the avoidance of doubt, where a
                race is postponed and rescheduled to another day at the same
                venue, relevant bets will stand where entries/declarations at
                the time of postponement remain unaltered or include any
                non-material addition(s) prior to the rescheduled race.
                <br />➢ Place Terms for Exchange markets
                <br />
                The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in
                the Market Information and is determined with reference to the
                number of runners when the market is loaded.
                <br />
                Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets
                will not be affected by further non-runners.
                <br />
                If the number of winners stated in the Market Information is
                equal to or is greater than the number of runners, all bets in
                this market will be void.
                <br />
                If the number of placed horses is less than the number of
                potential winners listed in the Market Information, the winners
                will only be the placed horse or horses.
                <br />➢ EW markets
                <br />
                The place portion of any "Each Way" bet will be settled
                according to the number of 'places' and at the fraction of the
                win portion profit stated in the market information.
                <br />
                For example: &ldquo;EW Terms: 1/5th odds, 3 places&rdquo;. That
                &ldquo;1/5th&rdquo; is applied to the traditional or fractional
                odds, which are 1 less than decimal odds, so the calculation of
                the Place odds corresponding to Win odds of 8.0 in this market
                is ((8.0 &ndash; 1) / 5) + 1 = 2.4.
                <br />
                Once opened, the number of places in 'EW&rdquo; markets will not
                be affected by further non-runners unless the number of
                &lsquo;places&rsquo; which are offered on the &lsquo;Each
                Way&rsquo; market is equal to or exceeds the number of runners
                in which case, the place portion of any EW bet will be voided at
                settlement.
                <br />➢ Winning Distance Bets
                <br />
                Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, winning
                distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances from
                each race on one particular day at a race meeting.
                <br />
                The winning distance in a race will be the officially declared
                distance between the first two horses past the post. However, if
                either the first or second horse past the post is disqualified
                because: (i) of an incorrect weight carried; (ii) they have
                taken the wrong course; (iii) the jockey of either horse fails
                to weigh in, or weighs in light after the race; then in each
                case the winning distance shall be that between the first and
                second horse under the official result.
                <br />
                For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any
                individual race will be 12 lengths for Flat races and 30 lengths
                for National Hunt races (which includes National Hunt Flat
                Races) and these distances will be applied where only one horse
                finishes a race. For distances below half a length, the
                following scale will be applied:
                <br />
                Nose: 0.05 length
                <br />
                Short-head: 0.1
                <br />
                Head: 0.2
                <br />
                Short-neck: 0.25
                <br />
                Neck: 0.3
                <br />
                If a meeting has three or more races abandoned or declared void,
                then all 'winning distance' bets will be void, unless the entire
                market has been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                When only one or two races are abandoned or declared void, then
                'winning distance' bets will be settled with a default distance
                used for each abandoned or void race. The default distances are
                2 lengths for Flat races and 10 lengths for National Hunt races.
                <br />
                In the case of a walkover the following distances will be
                applied:
                <br />
                Flat: 5 lengths
                <br />
                National Hunt: 12 lengths
                <br />➢ Non-Runner Rule
                <br />
                Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets
                already matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner.
                In order to make the adjustment applies a reduction factor to
                the remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a
                non-runner is a calculation (the details of which are described
                below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being placed, etc.
                as appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the
                other runners in the relevant market or markets.
                <br />
                Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does
                not subsequently come under starter's orders is deemed to be a
                non-runner.
                <br />
                When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction
                factor', based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a
                percentage. These reduction factors may be updated periodically
                at the discretion based on trading in the market, but after
                approximately 15 minutes (approximately 5 minutes for Australian
                and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of a given race,
                they will be updated only in exceptional circumstances.
                <br />
                Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but
                applied differently (as described below), and horses will have a
                different reduction factor for each market.
                <br />
                As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner
                or a highly likely non-runner, following a statement to the
                press from connections, the following will happen:
                <br />
                All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will
                be removed from the market.
                <br />
                In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is
                2.5% or greater, the traded price of all the matched bets on the
                remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers
                to lay will be cancelled. If the non-runner's reduction factor
                is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be applied and unmatched
                bets will not be cancelled.
                <br />
                In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners
                will be applied (even if less than 2.5%) and the potential
                winnings in relation to matched bets on the remaining horses
                will be reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final
                reduction factor. Only if the non-runner's reduction factor is
                4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers to lay be
                cancelled.
                <br />
                All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be
                adjusted to reflect their improved chance of winning.
                <br />
                Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck
                in-play. However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by
                error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets
                matched during this time will be subject to any later reduction
                factor, provided the market is turned out of play before the
                race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, it reserves
                the right to remove the runner after completion of the race. In
                this case only those bets matched prior to the off will be
                affected by a reduction factor.
                <br />
                In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error
                or following incorrect information regarding a runner&rsquo;s
                participation, it will reinstate both the runner and all
                previously matched bets associated with that runner. All bets
                made between the time of withdrawal and reinstatement will be
                void in both the place market and the win market. The reduction
                factor applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be
                reversed and the original prices will become valid.
                <br />
                Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the
                order in which they are brought to attention. If It becomes
                aware of more than one non-runner at the same time, it will
                remove the non-runners from the relevant markets in race card
                order.
                <br />
                If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or
                because of incorrect information regarding a runner&rsquo;s
                participation, It reserve the right to introduce the missing
                runner into the market at any time prior to settlement (even
                after the race has been run), provided that It has determined
                that the missing runner is not a material runner (i.e. a
                selection with a reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the
                win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play unmatched and
                matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not introduced
                before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be void.
                However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material
                runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new market
                will be loaded where possible.
                <br />➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets
                <br />
                In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.
                <br />
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0
                etc. And these might be further reduced if another horse is
                subsequently declared a non-runner.
                <br />
                In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win
                price. The advertised place terms will then apply to the revised
                win prices.
                <br />
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0.
                If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the
                corresponding price for the Place portion of the bet would
                reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
                <br />
                In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential
                winnings on the bet only, and not the traded price.
                <br />
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the potential winnings on all previously matched bets on the
                other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0
                would become 6.25. For example, a &pound;10 bet on a horse to be
                placed at a traded price of 8.0 would provide winnings of
                &pound;70. If there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of
                25% in the race, that factor will be applied to the &pound;70 of
                potential winnings leaving potential winnings of &pound;52.50.
                Therefore, the revised traded price will be 6.25.
                <br />
                The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is
                subsequently declared a non-runner, however odds cannot be
                reduced below 1.01.
                <br />
                Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets
                but will have a non-applicable reduction factor until It has
                received confirmation that it is a confirmed runner, in which
                case an applicable reduction factor may apply to it.
                <br />
                For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a
                non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be applied to all bets
                struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those
                markets of such non-runner. Likewise, should a reserve runner
                become a confirmed runner but subsequently become a non-runner,
                any reduction factor applicable to such non-runner will be
                applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the
                removal from those markets of such non-runner.
                <br />➢ Additional rules
                <br />
                Card numbers are posted as a guide only: bets are placed on a
                named horse.
                <br />
                Horses will not be coupled.
                <br />
                Where any horse(s) runs for purse money only it is deemed a
                non-runner for betting purposes. Should this result in the
                number of possible winners stated in the relevant Market
                Information being equal to or greater than the number of runners
                in the relevant market, all bets in the market will be void.
                <br />
                15. Ice Hockey
                <br />
                All bets on "Regular Time" markets will be settled on the result
                at the end of regular time, excluding overtime. All bets on "
                Moneyline " markets will be settled at the result at the end of
                regular time including "overtime and any shootouts that may be
                played".
                <br />
                'Puck Line' markets (i.e. handicap markets for NHL (National
                Hockey League) matches) will be settled on the final result
                including any overtime and any shootouts that may be played. All
                'handicap' markets on other matches will be settled on the
                result at the end of regular time, excluding overtime.
                <br />
                If a match does not start on the scheduled start date and is not
                completed within three days of the scheduled start date, all
                bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then,
                within three days of the scheduled start date, (a) at least 55
                minutes of play must have elapsed in any match; or (b) an
                official result must be 'called' by the relevant governing body;
                otherwise all bets will be void, except for those which have
                been unconditionally determined. In these instances, if the
                scores are tied then for " Moneyline " matches (where no tie is
                offered) dead heat rules will apply to bets on the outright
                match winner market.
                <br />
                16. Rowing
                <br />
                If a crew or individual starts a race but does not complete it
                then they will be deemed a loser providing at least one other
                crew or individual completes the race. If no crew or individual
                completes a race then all bets will be void.
                <br />
                If a regatta is cancelled for any reason, all bets will be void,
                except those on markets which have been unconditionally
                determined.
                <br />
                Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled
                on the official result of the relevant governing body at the
                time of the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result.
                <br />
                If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                determined in accordance with the official result of the
                relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting
                the result).
                <br />
                17. Rugby Union and Rugby League
                <br />
                'Tournament points' and 'tournament tries' bets will apply to
                all playing time, including any extra-time in any match where an
                official result is declared.
                <br />
                For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second
                half, the first half is deemed to have lasted 40 minutes,
                regardless of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or the try is
                scored in second half stoppage-time or extra-time, the result is
                80.
                <br />
                For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will
                count with the exception of 'first individual try scorer'
                markets where penalty tries will not count.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all
                bets will be void unless an official result is declared by the
                applicable governing body. Where an official result has been
                declared by the official governing body, that official result
                will govern match and handicap market settlement but all other
                markets will be void unless their result has already been
                determined at the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of
                abandonment, it would not have been possible for the outcome of
                the bet to change had the match continued to its natural
                conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points have been scored at
                the time a match is abandoned: (i) a bet placed on 35 points or
                more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii) a bet
                placed on 30-35 points to be scored would be settled as a losing
                bet and (iii) a bet placed on 40-45 points to be scored would be
                void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team to
                score last / team to score last try / last scoring play would
                all be void.
                <br />
                18. Snooker and Pool
                <br />
                In the event of a match starting but not being completed, the
                player progressing to the next round will be deemed the winner
                (or in the case of the final the player declared the winner).
                <br />
                If a match is not completed for any reason then bets on 'any
                correct score' or 'next frame' market will be void.
                <br />
                If a match is not completed for any reason, bets on any handicap
                market will be void unless the market has been unconditionally
                determined.
                <br />
                19. Soccer
                <br />
                If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
                Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly
                matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these
                bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a
                game is completed.
                <br />
                If a match has not started (or believes that a match will not
                have started) by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date,
                then all bets will be void unless it has knowledge that the
                match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its
                original start date.
                <br />
                If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and
                believes that the match will not have been completed by 23:59
                (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all markets, with
                the exception of any unconditionally determined markets, will be
                void unless it has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled
                to be played within three days of its original start date. If it
                does have knowledge that the game will be played within three
                days and the game is played within three days, then all bets
                will stand except if the match is restarted from the beginning.
                If the match is restarted from the beginning then all bets
                matched before the market went in-play will stand, but any bets
                placed in-play will be void, except for any bets placed in-play
                on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which
                will stand.
                <br />
                For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of
                play according to the match officials, plus any stoppage time.
                If a friendly match starts but is later abandoned or postponed
                and is not completed (i.e. the full duration of play according
                to match officials, plus any stoppage time) within three days of
                the scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those
                on markets which have been unconditionally determined. In the
                case of ambiguity over the official result from match officials,
                the outcome will be determined (acting reasonably) using
                information from independent sources.
                <br />
                If an official fixture lists different team details to those
                listed (for example, the team name, reserves, age group, gender,
                etc.), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be
                void. In all other cases, bets will stand (including instances
                where a team name is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in
                the name). If an official fixture is shown on the website under
                an incorrect competition name, then it reserves the right to
                void all bets matched on the affected markets.
                <br />
                If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a
                season, it has finished within the relegation positions which
                are relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom
                three league positions), bets on that team to be relegated will
                be settled as winning bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified,
                thrown out or removed from a league (i.e. in circumstances other
                than those where it has finished the season within the relevant
                relegation positions): (i) if such team is disqualified, thrown
                out or removed from the league before the relevant season has
                started, all bets on the affected market will be void (and a new
                market will subsequently be loaded) and (ii) if such team is
                disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league after the
                relevant season has started (or a determination is made by the
                applicable governing body, during the season, that the team will
                be thrown out or removed from the league following the
                season&rsquo;s conclusion), all bets on the affected team will
                be void. For the avoidance of doubt, if a points deduction is
                imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within the
                relegation places which are relevant to the applicable league,
                bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning
                bets.
                <br />
                The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the
                first league game has been played. For the purposes of this
                rule, markets relating to individual matches will not be deemed
                to be "affected markets".
                <br />
                'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at
                the start of the match. 'Shirt numbers' bets will include
                own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirt bears no number will be
                allocated the number 12.
                <br />
                For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets),
                the first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of
                stoppage time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 -
                10 Minutes" selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match.
                In other words, it runs from 0:00 until just before the clock
                hits 10:00. The "11 &ndash; 20 Minutes" selection runs from
                10:00 until just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle
                applies to each of the other selections in this market.
                <br />
                For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the
                league or competition stated in the Market Information count.
                For example, if a player joins a club mid-season any goals
                scored in a different league will not count, however goals
                scored for a different club in the same league will count. Own
                goals will not count.
                <br />
                In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur,
                such as 'number of corners', these will be determined on the
                basis of the number taken, rather than awarded.
                <br />
                For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the
                number of corners taken, any goal scorer or the time of a
                particular goal, the result will be determined (acting
                reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such
                cases, if any new information comes into the public domain
                within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting reasonably)
                determine either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or
                resettled in light of this new information; or (ii) to wait for
                further information before deciding whether to reinstate or
                resettle the market. Except it has announced that it is waiting
                for further information, any information that comes into the
                public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled
                shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such
                information may have led to a different result).
                <br />
                20. Swimming
                <br />
                Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled
                on the official result of the relevant governing body at the
                time of the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result.
                <br />
                If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                determined in accordance with the official result of the
                relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting
                the result)
                <br />
                21. Tennis
                <br />
                If a player or pairing retires or is disqualified in any match,
                the player or pairing progressing to the next round (or winning
                the tournament in the case of a final) will be deemed the
                winner. However, if less than one set has been completed at the
                time of the retirement or disqualification then all bets
                relating to that individual match will be void.
                <br />
                All bets relating to the number of occurrences of certain events
                within a tournament will be void if the tournament is reduced in
                length, postponed or cancelled, except for those on markets
                which have been unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                All bets will stand regardless of changes to scheduled venues,
                including any changes to a different type of surface.
                <br />
                If the scheduled duration of a match is reduced or increased in
                the number of games/sets required to win, all bets will be void
                except for those on markets which have been unconditionally
                determined. Please note that this does not apply to &lsquo;Match
                Odds&rsquo; or &lsquo;Set Winner&rsquo; markets on Davis Cup
                matches or &lsquo;dead rubber&rsquo; matches that have been
                shortened from five sets to three sets after the market has been
                loaded, provided that the match has been shortened in accordance
                with the competition&rsquo;s rules.
                <br />
                Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a
                match, a retirement or disqualification during a game or set
                will render bets on that game or set market and all individual
                game or set markets void except those on markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
                <br />
                22. Winter sports (which may include, amongst others, Alpine
                Skiing, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing and Ski-Jumping)
                <br />
                Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled
                on the official result of the relevant governing body at the
                time of the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result.
                <br />
                If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                determined in accordance with the official result of the
                relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement
                of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting
                the result).
                <br />
                Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, if an event
                is abandoned, postponed or cancelled, all bets will be void
                unless (a) the event is completed at the same venue within 7
                days of the official scheduled completion date; or (b) a result
                is 'called' by the relevant governing body.
                <br />
                The General Rules will apply for 'match bets'. However, in
                respect of "Nordic Combined" if all competitors involved in the
                match bet do not start both sections of the event (ski jumping
                and cross country) then bets will be void.

                authorisation code from the payment issuing institution. If your
                card&rsquo;s issuer gives no such authorisation, your account
                will not be credited with those funds.

                must make all payments to us in good faith and not attempt to
                reverse a payment made or take any action which will cause such
                payment to be reversed by a third party in order to avoid a
                liability legitimately incurred. You will reimburse us for any
                charge-backs, denial or reversal of payment you make and any
                loss suffered by us as a consequence thereof. We reserve the
                right to also impose an administration fee of &euro;60, or
                currency equivalent per charge-back, denial or reversal of
                payment you make.
              </p>
              <p>
                We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment
                processors and or merchant banks to process payments made by you
                and you agree to be bound by their terms and conditions
                providing they are made aware to you and those terms do not
                conflict with these Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                All transactions made on our site might be checked to prevent

              <p>9. Errors</p>
              <p>
                In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or
                processes, all bets are rendered void. You are under an
                obligation to inform us immediately as soon as you become aware
                of any error with the service. In the event of communication or
                system errors or bugs or viruses occurring in connection with
                the service and/or payments made to you as a result of a defect
                or effort in the Service, we will not be liable to you or to any
                third party for any direct or indirect costs, expenses, losses
                or claims arising or resulting from such errors, and we reserve
                the right to void all games/bets in question and take any other
                action to correct such errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event of a casino system malfunction, or disconnection
                issues, all bets are rendered void. In the event of such error
                or any system failure or game error that results in an error in
                any odds calculation, charges, fees, rake, bonuses or payout, or
                any currency conversion as applicable, or other casino system
                malfunction (the &ldquo;Casino Error&rdquo;), we reserve the
                right to declare null and void any wagers or bets that were the
                subject of such Casino Error and to take any money from your
                Account relating to the relevant bets or wagers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in
                posting lines. However, if as a result of human error or system
                problems a bet is accepted at an odd that is: materially
                different from those available in the general market at the time
                the bet was made; or clearly incorrect given the chance of the
                event occurring at the time the bet was made then we reserve the
                right to cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager
                made after an event has started.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to
                adjust your account to rectify any mistake. An example of such a
                mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where we enter a
                result of an event incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds
                in your Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant
                outstanding amount relating to any erroneous bets or wagers.
                Accordingly, we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete
                any pending plays, whether placed with funds resulting from the
                error or not.

                If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the
                general rule will not apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the
                event&rsquo;s settlement; we do not recognise protested or
                overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an
                event suspended after the start of competition will be decided
                according to the wagering rules specified for that sport by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries
                will be entertained after that period of time. Within 72 hours
                after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct
                the results due to human error, system error or mistakes made by
                the referring results source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be
                determined by us and are subject to change without prior written
                notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual
                Accounts as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Customers are solely responsible for their own account
                transactions. Please be sure to review your wagers for any
                mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction is complete,
                it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing
                or duplicate wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain
                discrepancy requests because a play is missing or duplicated.
                Customers may review their transactions in the My Account
                section of the site after each session to ensure all requested
                wagers were accepted.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No
                Proposition, the contestant must enter and compete in the event.
              </p>
              <p>
                We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and
                away teams by indicating the home and away team by means of
                vertical placement on the desktop site version. This means in
                American Sports we would place the home team on the bottom. For
                Non-US sports, we would indicate the home team on top. In the
                case of a neutral venue, we attempt to include the letter
                &ldquo;N&rdquo; next to the team names to indicate this. For the
                Asian and mobile versions, we do not distinguish between
                European and American Sports. On the Asian and mobile versions
                of the site, the home team is always listed first. However, we
                do not guarantee the accuracy of this information and unless
                there is an official venue change subsequent to bets being
                placed, all wagers have action.
              </p>
              <p>
                A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading
                that is associated with the matchup. For example, two teams from
                the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup
                is mistakenly placed in the League offering, the game/match will
                still have action, as long as the matchup is correct. In other
                words, a matchup will have action as long as the two teams are
                correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is
                placed on our Website.
              </p>
              <p>
                If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the
                governing body, then all wagers on the event have no action. If
                an event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers
                have action based on the date announced by the governing body.

                In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super
                Bowl winner, etc.), the winner as determined by the Governing
                Body will also be declared the winner for betting purposes
                except when the minimum number of games required for the future
                to have &ldquo;action&rdquo; has not been completed.

                14. Gambling By Those Under Age
              </p>
              <p>
                If we suspect that you are or receive notification that you are
                currently under 18 years or were under 18 years (or below the
                age of majority as stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction
                applicable to you) when you placed any bets through the service
                your account will be suspended to prevent you placing any
                further bets or making any withdrawals from your account. We
                will then investigate the matter, including whether you have
                been betting as an agent for, or otherwise on behalf, of a
                person under 18 years (or below the age of majority as
                stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you).
                If having found that you: (a) are currently; (b) were under 18
                years or below the majority age which applies to you at the
                relevant time; or (c) have been betting as an agent for or at
                the behest of a person under 18 years or below the majority age
                which applies:
              </p>
              <p>
                i. all winnings currently or due to be credited to your account
                will be retained;
                <br />
                ii. all winnings gained from betting through the service whilst
                under age must be paid to us on demand (if you fail to comply
                with this provision we will seek to recover all costs associated
                with recovery of such sums); and/or
                <br />
                iii. any monies deposited in your Skyexchange.com account which
                are not winnings will be returned to you.
                <br />
                This condition also applies to you if you are over the age of 18
                years but you are placing your bets within a jurisdiction which
                specifies a higher age than 18 years for legal betting and you
                are below that legal minimum age in that jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event we suspect you are in breach of the provisions of
                this Clause 15 or are attempting to rely on them for a
                fraudulent purpose, we reserve the right to take any action
                necessary in order to investigate the matter, including
                informing the relevant law enforcement agencies.

                Senior Management are responsible for the overall compliance
                policy of velkiex and ensuring adequate resources are provided
                for the proper training of staff and the implementing of risk
                systems. This includes computer software to assist in oversight.
                Senior management will receive and consider the monthly
                compliance reports sent by the MLRO and authorise changes based
                on the recommendations if required.

              <p>15.3 The Compliance Programme</p>
              <p>5.1 The Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)</p>
              <p>
                SKYEXCHANGE has appointed a MLRO with full responsibility for
                velkiex&rsquo;s anti-money laundering compliance.
              </p>
              <p>The MLRO:</p>
              <p>
                Will monitor the day-to-day operation of velkiex TRADING&rsquo;s
                AML/CFT policies and respond to any reasonable request made by
                the law enforcement and/or the Gaming Control Board, Curacao.
                <br />

                responsibilities, which includes direct access to the Gaming
                Control Board, Curacao and appropriate law enforcement agencies,
                in order that any suspicious activity may be reported to the
                right quarter as soon as is practicable.
                <br />
                Has the authority and the resources necessary to discharge their
                responsibilities effectively.
                <br />
                Is from a senior level and has direct access to senior
                management and the board of directors.
                <br />
                May choose to delegate certain duties to other employees, but
                wherever such a delegation is made, the MLRO retains ultimate
                responsibility for the implementation of the compliance regime.
                <br />
                At least annually, the MLRO will issue a report (the MLRO
                Report) to the senior management of velkiex on the operation and
                effectiveness of the money laundering controls. This report will
                cover improvements, remedial programmes, the outcome of any
                internal audit reviews of the AML/CFT processes, and other
                relevant items.
                <br />
                15.4 Compliance Policies and Procedures
              </p>
              <p>
                velkiex has policies and procedures to assess the risks related
                to money laundering and terrorist financing. These policies and
                procedures are:
              </p>
              <p>
                Written and maintained by the MLRO under the supervision of
                senior management
                <br />
                Approved by senior management
                <br />
                Communicated, understood and adhered to by everyone dealing with
                customers or their transactions, including those who work in the
                areas relating to customer identification, record keeping, and
                reportable transactions, who need enough information to process
                and complete a transaction properly as well as to ascertain the
                identity of customers and keep records as required.
                <br />
                Policies and procedures which incorporate the reporting, record
                keeping, customer identification, risk assessment and risk
                mitigation requirements applicable.
                <br />
                Although directors and senior officers may not be involved in
                day-to-day compliance, they need to understand the statutory
                duties placed upon them, their staff and velkiex itself.
              </p>
              <p>15.4.1 The Risk-Based Approach</p>
              <p>
                In money laundering and terrorist financing, a risk-based
                approach covers the following:
              </p>
              <p>
                The risk assessment of customer relationships and business
                activities;
                <br />
                The risk mitigation to implement controls to handle identified
                risks;
                <br />
                Keeping customer identification, beneficial ownership and
                business relationship information up to date; and
                <br />
                The ongoing monitoring of business relationships and
                transactions.
                <br />
                Existing regulatory obligations, such as for customer
                identification, are a minimum baseline requirement. Where
                enhanced due diligence is appropriate, a principle of the
                risk-based approach is to focus resources where they are most
                needed to manage risks within our tolerance level.
              </p>
              <p>15.4.2 Risk Mitigation</p>
              <p>
                Risk mitigation is implementing controls to limit the potential
                money laundering and terrorist financing risks identified in the
                risk assessment so as to stay within the risk tolerance level.
                When the risk assessment determines that risk is high for money
                laundering or terrorist financing, then we will develop risk
                mitigation strategies and apply them.
              </p>
              <p>
                In all situations, risk mitigation controls and measures
                include:
              </p>
              <p>
                Focussing on operations (products and services, customers and
                business relationships, geographic locations, and any other
                relevant factors) that are more vulnerable to abuse by money
                launderers and criminals;
                <br />
                Informing senior management of compliance initiatives,
                identified compliance deficiencies, corrective action taken, and
                suspicious transaction reports filed;
                <br />
                Providing for program continuity despite changes in management,
                employees or structure;
                <br />
                Focussing on meeting all regulatory record keeping and reporting
                requirements, recommendations for anti-money laundering and
                anti-terrorist financing compliance and providing for timely
                updates in response to changes in requirements;
                <br />
                Enabling the timely identification of reportable transactions
                and ensure accurate filing of required reports;
                <br />
                Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
                compliance into job descriptions and performance evaluations of
                appropriate personnel; and
                <br />
                Providing for adequate supervision and training of employees
                that handle currency transactions, complete reports, monitor for
                suspicious transactions, or engage in any other activity that
                forms part of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist
                financing program.
                <br />
                Increasing awareness of high risk situations within all business
                lines;
                <br />
                Increasing the frequency of ongoing monitoring of transactions
                or business relationships;
                <br />
                Escalating the approval of the establishment of an account or
                relationship even if not otherwise required to do so;
                <br />
                Increasing the levels of ongoing controls and reviews of
                relationships;
                <br />
                Requesting high-risk customers provide additional, documented
                information regarding controls they have implemented to
                safeguard their operations from abuse by money launderers and
                terrorists;
                <br />
                Verifying the identity of customers by reference to reliable,
                independent source documents, data or information;
                <br />
                Preventing any transaction with a potential customer until
                identification and account opening information has been
                obtained;
                <br />
                Implementing an appropriate process to approve all relationships
                identified as high-risk as part of the customer acceptance
                process or declining to do business with potential customers
                because they exceed velkiex&rsquo;s risk tolerance level;
                <br />
                Implementing a process to exit from an existing high-risk
                relationship which management sees as exceeding
                SKYEXCHANGE&rsquo;s risk tolerance level.
                <br />
                15.4.3 Risk Assessment
              </p>
              <p>
                SKYEXCHANGE is required to and will analyse potential threats
                and vulnerabilities to money laundering and terrorist financing
                to which the business may be exposed to in a risk assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The risk assessment will document and consider the following:
              </p>
              <p>
                Products, services and delivery channels
                <br />
                Geographic locations and areas of operation
                <br />
                Customers
                <br />
                The risk assessment may identify high-risk situations for which
                risk mitigation controls and monitoring may be required. The
                risk assessment is not static and will change over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a customer is identified as high-risk, they are subject to
                more frequent ongoing monitoring and updating of customer
                identification information, as well as any other appropriate
                enhanced measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Skyexchange shall perform an initial risk assessment at the
                beginning of a new customer relationship and for existing
                customers on an ongoing basis.
              </p>
              <p>15.5 Client and Business Risk</p>
              <p>15.5.1 Products, Services and Delivery Channels</p>
              <p>
                velkiex will identify products and services or combinations of
                them that may pose an elevated risk of money laundering or
                terrorist financing. For example, products and services that
                support the movement and conversion of assets into, through and
                out of the financial system pose a high risk. Certain services
                have also been identified by financial regulators, governmental
                authorities or other credible sources as being potentially
                high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wire transactions;
                <br />
                Transactions involving third parties;
                <br />
                Non-face-to-face business relationships.
                <br />
                15.5.2 Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain geographic locations potentially pose an elevated risk
                for money laundering and terrorist financing. These have been
                described by the FATF and by other resources such as
                Transparency International.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clients from, or identified as linked to these countries will be
                regarded as high risk:
              </p>
              <p>
                Any country subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar
                measures;
                <br />
                Any country identified by credible sources as providing funding
                or support for terrorist activities, or that have designated
                terrorist organisations operating within their country;
                <br />
                Any country known to be a tax haven, source of narcotics or
                other significant criminal activity;
                <br />
                Any country identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
                as non-cooperative in the fight against money laundering or
                terrorist financing or subject to a FATF statement;
                <br />
                Any country identified by credible sources as lacking
                appropriate money laundering or terrorist financing laws and
                regulations, or as having significant levels of corruption.
                <br />
                SKYEXCHANGE does not do business with or provide services to
                anyone in any country belonging to a list of select countries
                subject to comprehensive international sanctions.
              </p>
              <p>15.5.3 Customer Relationships</p>
              <p>
                The risk assessment requires to know your customers
                (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;). This is not limited to identification or
              </p>
              <p>
                record keeping, but it is also about understanding the customers
                &ndash; including their activities,
              </p>
              <p>transaction patterns, and how they operate.</p>
              <p>Examples of the factors that will be considered are:</p>
              <p>
                How long we have known the customer and had a business
                relationship;
                <br />
                Customers wanting to carry out large transactions;
                <br />
                Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues;
                <br />
                Customers with multiple online complaints;
                <br />
                Customers whose identification is difficult to verify;
                <br />
                Customers whose who are politically exposed.
                <br />
                Each customer is risk-rated as either posing a low, medium or
                high risk of money laundering and/or
              </p>
              <p>
                terrorist financing. The rating given at the beginning of the
                business relationship may be adjusted
              </p>
              <p>
                after the re-assessment and may change over time. The level of
                customer due diligence will vary
              </p>
              <p>
                depending on the risk rating of the customer at the beginning of
                the relationship and as it changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For all high-risk players, enhanced due diligence is applied
                right away.
              </p>
              <p>15.5.4 Regulatory risk</p>
              <p>
                Regulatory risk means not meeting our obligations under
                applicable legislation. Examples of breaches of regulatory
                obligations include:
              </p>
              <p>Customer identification not done properly;</p>
              <p>
                Failure to train staff adequately;
                <br />
                Bot having an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
                (AML/CFT) program;
                <br />
                Failure to report suspicious transactions;
                <br />
                Not having an MLRO;

                15.5 Compliance Training
              </p>
              <p>
                velkiex has a training program for all relevant employees and
                other individuals who act on behalf of the Company. The goal of
                this training is to make sure that those who have contact with
                customers, who see customer transaction activity or who handle
                funds in any way understand the reporting, customer
                identification and record keeping requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                All new employees of velkiex are required to complete anti-money
                laundering and terrorist financing compliance training within
                their first three months of employment, and for customer-facing
                staff training is delivered prior to dealing with customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training is currently conducted through a customised course. The
                training program is delivered electronically (via a learning
                management system). The training program is reviewed and updated
                by the MLRO to reflect requirements as they change. The
                compliance training includes a test which everyone must pass in
                order to consider their training complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure employee training is kept up to date, all existing
                employees will receive follow up training on new and existing
                AML and regulatory requirements on a regular basis (at least
                within one year of their last training). If the online training
                test results show that a staff member does not understanding the
                training material, SKYEXCHANGE will ensure that the staff member
                receives specialised one-on-one training to understand the
                material.
              </p>
              <p>
                An employee log of assigned and completed training materials is
                kept by the MLRO and the Human Resources department for
                administrative purposes. Retention of these records is for a
                period of five years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Compliance training is adjusted in accordance to the
                employee&rsquo;s role within the company. The MLRO will review
                functions and arrange to provide suitable and customised
                training.
              </p>
              <p>Our training will include at a minimum:</p>
              <p>
                An understanding of the reporting, customer identification and
                record keeping requirements as well as penalties for not meeting
                those requirements;
                <br />
                Making all employees aware of the internal policies and
                procedures for deterring and detecting money laundering and
                terrorist financing that are associated with their jobs;
                <br />
                Delivering to employees and suppliers a clear understanding of
                their responsibilities under these policies and procedures;
                <br />
                All those who have contact with customers, who see customer
                transaction activity, who handle cash or funds in any way or who
                are responsible for implementing or overseeing the compliance
                regime must understand the reporting, customer identification
                and record keeping requirements.
                <br />
                Making all employees aware of how velkiex is vulnerable to abuse
                by criminals laundering the proceeds of crime or by terrorists
                financing their activities;
                <br />
                Making all employees and agents aware that they cannot disclose
                that they have made a suspicious transaction report, or disclose
                the contents of such a report, with the intent to prejudice a
                criminal investigation, whether it has started or not;
                <br />
                That all employees and agents understanding that no criminal or
                civil proceedings may be brought against them for making a
                report in good faith;
                <br />
                Background information on money laundering so everyone who needs
                to can understand what money laundering is, why criminals choose
                to launder money and how the process usually works;
                <br />
                Details of what terrorist financing is and how that process
                usually works.
                <br />
                The MLRO is responsible for ensuring that everyone is informed
                of changes in anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing
                legislation, policies and procedures, and current developments
                in money laundering or terrorist activity financing schemes
                particularly relevant to their jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain employees, such as those in compliance, customer
                services and operations, require types of specialised additional
                training which will be provided either through external services
                or internally. The training program is reviewed and updated to
                reflect changes in requirements.
              </p>
              <p>15.6. Minimum standards &ndash; KYC POLICY</p>
              <p>
                velkiex has established standards regarding Know-Your-Customer
                (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;). These standards require due diligence on
                each prospective customer before entering into a business
                relationship via identification and verification of his identity
                and, as the case may be, his representatives and beneficial
                owners on the basis of documents, data or information obtained
                from a reliable and independent source compliant with the
                domestic and European AML/CFT legislation and regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interpretation of the KYC principle begins with identification
                of the customer by means of the necessary identification
                documents.
              </p>
              <p>
                That identification, completed by other information gathered,
                enables the Customer Acceptance Policy to be applied.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to these objective criteria, there are subjective
                elements which may arouse suspicions regarding a customer and to
                which particular attention should be paid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, as KYC does not involve static data, but dynamic data
                through the relationship with the customer, it also needs
                follow-up and ongoing monitoring of the customer.
              </p>
              <p>15.6.1. Customer identification and verification (KYC)</p>
              <p>
                The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial
                relations is a vital element, both for the regulations relating
                to money laundering and for the KYC policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                This identification relies on the following fundamental
                principles :
              </p>
              <p>
                Each customer (= each individual person and/or each person
                involved in the case of a legal entity) must be identified by
                means of original supporting documents.
                <br />
                These documents will be recorded in a centralised system.
                <br />
                The identification must be completed by "face-to-face" contact.
                <br />
                Distance identification is also authorised and possible within a
                dedicated acceptance process, but limits the opportunity to
                carry out certain transactions or to access certain products.
                <br />
                Each person identified must be registered by IT means.
                <br />A person will not be accepted as a customer if the
                identification process proves to be incomplete.
                <br />
                The specific case of the due diligence exercised on the
                acceptance of politically exposed persons (PEP).
              </p>
              <p>
                Concrete application at velkiex is reflected by a specific
                identification procedure for customers referenced as PEP,
                whatever their place of residence.
              </p>
              <p>15.6.2. Risk Profile calculation</p>
              <p>
                To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to
                be exercised with regard to the Customer, a
                &ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; risk profile is calculated first of all
                on entry into relations (Low, Medium, High), and is then
                recalculated daily.
              </p>
              <p>15.6.3. Customer acceptance policy</p>
              <p>15.6.3.1. Customer Identification</p>
              <p>
                Client Identification is intended to confirm the existence and
                identify the individual with which SKYEXCHANGE has a business
                relationship and obtain supporting identity information. This
                includes measures to:
              </p>
              <p>
                Confirm the existence of the individual through identification
                documents;
                <br />
                Conduct due diligence into the identity of the customer
                including:
                <br />
                Cross-referencing customer names against government watch lists;
                <br />
                Determining whether the customers are politically exposed
                persons;
                <br />
                Determining whether any third parties are involved;
                <br />
                Reviewing relevant publicly available information on the
                customer (e.g. adverse media, social media);
                <br />
                Reviewing their background, reputation;
                <br />
                Keep records of all information and documents obtained.
                <br />
                15.6.3.2. Identifying Information for Customers
              </p>
              <p>
                This section sets out the standard identification requirements
                for individuals who have entered into a business relationship
                with velkiex. This outline is likely to be sufficient for most
                situations. If, however, the customer is assessed as presenting
                a higher money laundering or terrorist financing risk, in line
                with our identified risk matrix, then velkiex requires additional
                identity information to be provided and increase the level or
                verification accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the result of the standard verification check gives rise
                to concern or uncertainty over identity, the number of matches
                that will be required to be reasonably satisfied as to the
                individual&rsquo;s identity will increase. Any concerns must be
                reported to the MLRO.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a customer is unable to produce a primary ID, the reasons for
                this should be noted and they may not be able to maintain an
                account.
              </p>
              <p>All documentary evidence must be recent.</p>
              <p>
                Passports and drivers&rsquo; licenses should be valid and not
                expired
                <br />
                Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months
                <br />
                In terms of beneficial ownership, we will ask every customer
                whether they are acting in their own capacity or on behalf of
                another person. If they are acting for another person then we
                will require details of such.
              </p>
              <p>Sources of evidence</p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Documents issued by a government department, incorporating the
                person&rsquo;s name and residential address or their date of
                birth. E.g. (for proof of address or date of birth):
              </p>
              <p>

                account (not correspondence); statements printed off the
                internet are not acceptable on their own (a secondary check will
                be required such as a reference to a telephone directory
                including an online telephone directory); or

                <br />
                When accepting evidence of identity from a customer, it is
                important that we make sufficient checks on the evidence
                provided to satisfy us of the customer&rsquo;s identity, and
                that we keep a record of the checks made. This will be done by
                the MLRO or under the supervision of the MLRO.
              </p>
              <p>Usual checks on photo ID may include:</p>
              <p>Likeness against the customer</p>
              <p>
                Does the date of birth on the evidence match the apparent age of
                the customer?
                <br />
                Is the ID valid?
                <br />
                Is the spelling of names the same as other documents provided by
                the customer?
                <br />
                Checks on secondary evidence of ID may include:
              </p>
              <p>
                Do the addresses match the address given on the photo ID?
                <br />
                Does the name of the customer match with the name on the photo
                ID?
                <br />
                15.6.3.3. Identity Verification Triggers
              </p>
              <p>
                Verification of the identity of the customer occurs either when
                the customer has reached the &euro;2,000 threshold or if the
                player is considered to be a high-risk player upon registration.
                The main trigger for Identity Verification is considered a
                single transaction (or smaller, linked transactions) that reach
                or exceed &euro;2,000 either at deposit or withdrawal stage. For
                example, transactions will be considered as linked when they are
                carried out by the same customer during a single period of being
                logged on to the SKYEXCHANGE website or if they are carried out
                in 48 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                In all cases, the customer will receive a notification to upload
                identity verification documents listed above. Each document that
                is provided by customers to SKYEXCHANGE is checked manually by
                dedicated staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further events that may trigger Identity Verification processes:
              </p>
              <p>
                When a customer requests a withdrawal to a different account
                than one that was used to make a deposit (e.g. due to the fact
                that certain payment service providers do not support incoming
                payments or other reasons). In these cases, the withdrawal
                requests will be immediately deducted from the customer&rsquo;s
                account, however, will not be processed until the
                customer&rsquo;s identity has been verified to ensure that the
                funds are going to the right person;
                <br />
                When a customer makes multiple deposits within a short timeframe
                (five or more deposits in one hour);
                <br />
                Staff identifies suspicious deposit patterns and or several
                payment cards are used (three or more different payment methods
                used within one week);
                <br />
                Registration country and IP do not match &ndash; In such cases,
                the player account may not be blocked and the player may still
                make deposits and play games, however, no withdrawal will be
                allowed until verification has been carried out;
                <br />
                When a deposit exceeds &euro;5,000.
                <br />
                Copies will be kept of all the documents used for
                identification.
              </p>
              <p>15.6.3.4. Additional Documents</p>
              <p>
                Additional documents may be requested from customers to
                substantiate their activities or to better understand their
                patters:
              </p>
              <p>
                Proof of Bank Account &ndash; This may be a screenshot or copy
                of the bank statement stating the customer&rsquo;s name and IBAN
                and the name of the bank (for instances when a customer requests
                a withdrawal to be deposited to a bank account);
                <br />
                Proof of Payment Card &ndash; This may be a photo or copy of the
                front side of the card in question or a bank statement that will
                include both the card details and the name of the customer (for
                instances when suspicious deposit patters are identified)
                &ndash;
                <br />
                To protect the customer&rsquo;s card data, SKYEXCHANGE informs
                them that they may obfuscate some of the card details, however,
                the customer&rsquo;s name, as well as the first and last four
                digits of the card number must be visible.
                <br />
                Bank Statements and Payslips &ndash; These may be requested from
                customers displaying potentially problematic gambling patterns
                and when external information available on the customer does not
                validate the amounts being gambled. In such cases SKYEXCHANGE
                would ask its higher volume customers for documents which would
                support the funds being spent on gambling.
                <br />
                15.6.3.5.Mitigation of Impersonation Risk
              </p>
              <p>
                Various additional customer identity checks are permitted on a
                risk-based approach. These checks may include:
              </p>
              <p>
                Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account
                in the customer&rsquo;s name with an EU/EEA regulated credit
                institution or one from an equivalent jurisdiction;
                <br />
                Verifying additional aspects of the customer&rsquo;s identity,
                or of their electronic &lsquo;footprint&rsquo;;
                <br />
                Telephone contact with the customer prior to opening the account
                on a home or business number which has been verified
                (electronically or otherwise) or a call to the customer before
                further transactions are permitted, using it to verify
                additional aspects of personal identity information that have
                been previously provided during the setting up of the account;
                <br />
                15.6.3.6. Keeping Information Up-to-Date
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the identity of a customer has been confirmed, it does not
                have to be confirmed again. However, if there is any doubt about
                the information held, then that identification will be obtained
                again, including the identification of the customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                velkiex may review the customer documentation and then update it
                as appropriate. Any changes to identification such as a change
                of name of the customer would require new documents to be
                obtained.
              </p>
              <p>15.6.4. Ongoing transaction monitoring</p>
              <p>
                There are certain automated controls in place to monitor
                customer activities, for example:
              </p>
              <p>
                First time deposits;
                <br />
                Cash-out alerts for cash-outs greater than &euro;1,000;
                <br />
                Activity alerts when customer pays to, or stakes with the casino
                &euro;2,000 during any period of 24 hours;
                <br />
                Credit Card BIN alerts (when Credit Card country differs from
                player account country/IP);
                <br />
                In addition, all cash-out requests are processed manually by the
                Payments Team and are reviewed on a daily basis. Every request
                undergoes security checks before approval in order to determine
                that the origin of the funds/wins is compliant with the Gaming
                Control Board Curacao Policy and the terms and conditions of the
                Company.
              </p>
              <p>15.7. Organization of internal control</p>
              <p>
                Any member of velkiex can report suspicious activities to the
                MLRO, as velkiex&rsquo;s Nominated Officer. A suspicious activity
                is one where it is known, or suspected, there are reasonably
                grounds to know or suspect that a person is engaged in, or
                attempting, money laundering or terrorist financing.
              </p>
              <p>15.7.1. Suspicious transactions reporting</p>
              <p>
                Having knowledge means knowing something to be true. Knowledge
                can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances; so, for
                example, a failure to ask obvious questions may imply knowledge.
                The knowledge must, however, have come to velkiex during the
                course of business, or from a disclosure (to the MLRO).
              </p>
              <p>
                Suspicion is more subjective and falls short of proof based on
                firm evidence. Suspicion is more than speculation and is based
                on some foundation.
              </p>
              <p>
                An unusual transaction is not necessarily suspicious. Unusual
                patterns of gambling, including the spending of particularly
                large amounts of money in relation to the casino or
                customer&rsquo;s profile, should receive attention, but unusual
                behaviour should not necessarily lead to grounds for knowledge
                or suspicion of money laundering, or the making of a report to
                the FIAU. The MLRO is required to assess all of the
                circumstances and, in some cases, it may be helpful to ask the
                customer or others more questions. The choice depends on what is
                already known about the customer and the transaction, and how
                easy it is to make enquiries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Members of staff who consider a transaction or activity to be
                suspicious, would not necessarily be expected to know or to
                establish the exact nature of any underlying criminal offence,
                or that the particular funds or property were those arising from
                a crime, money laundering or terrorist financing.
                &ldquo;Reasonable grounds to know or suspect&rdquo; introduces
                an objective test of suspicion. The test is likely to be met
                when there are facts or circumstances, known to the member of
                staff, from which a reasonable person (in a payments firm) would
                have inferred knowledge, or formed the suspicion, that another
                person was engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing.
              </p>
              <p>
                A defence of failing to meet the test of suspicion, would be for
                staff to demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to know the
                customer and the rationale for the transaction, activity or
                instruction.
              </p>
              <p>15.7.2 How to Make a Suspicious Activity Report</p>
              <p>
                Any member of staff, who is suspicious that a transaction may
                involve money laundering or who becomes aware during the course
                of their work that someone else is involved in money laundering,
                must make a disclosure to the MLRO using the velkiex Suspicious
                Transaction Report form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once completed, the form should be printed off. The member of
                staff making the report must sign and date the form before
                giving it to the MLRO. The MLRO will take note of the date and
                time of report receipt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon receipt of the form by the MLRO, they will then decide what
                is to be done as a result of the report, e.g., whether the
                matter must be reported to Gaming Control board, Curacao. or
                not, or further enquiries made and record its decision and the
                reason for it in the customer files. The member of staff
                concerned must be informed of the decision and the reasons for
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the matter is to be referred to GCB, the MLRO or a
                subordinate will complete the FIAU report form and discussing
                with the reporting member of staff how matters with the customer
                are to be conducted from that stage. The GCB report form must be
                signed off by the MLRO or the CEO.
              </p>
              <p>
                velkiex must not proceed with a transaction whilst we await
                consent from the concerned from GCB it is given 7 working days
                (not including weekends or bank holidays) to consider the
                report.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we hear nothing then we may continue with the transaction but
                not inform the customer about the report. GCB may give consent
                to proceed earlier than this time limit. They may also refuse
                consent in which case they have a further 31 calendar days
                (including weekends or bank holidays) to further consider the
                report. After this they must either begin proceedings or allow
                the transaction to continue.
              </p>
              <p>
                The MLRO will submit a softcopy version of the report to the
                GCB. Any paper file for each matter will be kept by the MLRO.
              </p>
              <p>
                There must be no record on the customer file or on the computer
                system which refers in any way to suspicious activity reporting,
                money laundering, etc., to avoid the risk of tipping off. It is
                a criminal offence to inform a customer that a SAR has been
                submitted, or to inform them of an investigation into their
                affairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                All records of SARs will be kept in the central reporting file,
                which is kept by the MLRO.
              </p>
              <p>15.7.3 How to Identify Suspicious Activity</p>
              <p>
                Transactions may give reasonable grounds to suspect that they
                are related to money laundering or terrorist activity financing
                regardless of the sum of money involved. There is no monetary
                threshold for making a SAR. Suspicious transactions may involve
                several factors that on their own seem insignificant, but
                together raise suspicion that the transaction is related to the
                commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or
                terrorist activity financing offence, or both. As a general
                guide, a transaction may be connected to money laundering or
                terrorist activity financing when we think that it (or a group
                of transactions) raises questions or gives rise to discomfort,
                apprehension or mistrust.
              </p>
              <p>
                SKYEXCHANGE will examine, as far as reasonably possible, the
                background and purpose of all complex, unusual large
                transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which
                have no apparent economic or lawful purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                The context in which the transaction occurs or is attempted is a
                significant factor in assessing suspicion and this will vary
                from one customer to another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transactions will be evaluated in terms of what seems
                appropriate and is within normal practices in business and based
                on our knowledge of the customer. The fact that transactions do
                not appear to be in keeping with normal industry practices may
                be a relevant factor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reasonable evaluation of relevant factors, including the
                knowledge of the customer's business, financial history,
                background and behaviour is the basis of assessing suspicion.
                Behaviour is suspicious, not people. We have listed below some
                indicators to help with this assessment.
              </p>
              <p>15.7.4 Indicators of Suspicious Transactions</p>
              <p>
                Certain products, services, activities or channels may pose a
                higher risk of misuse for money laundering. Listed below are
                several anti-money laundering risk indicators or &ldquo;red
                flags&rdquo; that might be grounds for suspicion. The list is
                not exhaustive and not conclusive but will be used as a guide
                for inquiry and follow-up, alongside other material.
              </p>
              <p>
                A single indicator does not necessarily indicate reasonable
                grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing
                activity. However, if several indicators are present during one
                or a series of transactions, then we will take a closer look at
                other factors before deciding whether the transaction must be
                reported.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the case of a transaction aborted in the belief that the
                property is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist
                or a terrorist group, then there must be a terrorist property
                report. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the
                transaction is related to an attempted commission of a terrorist
                activity financing or money laundering offence, then a
                suspicious transaction report about the attempted transaction is
                also required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Becoming aware of certain indicators could trigger reasonable
                grounds to suspect that one or more transactions from the past
                (that had not previously seemed suspicious) were related to
                money laundering or terrorist financing.
